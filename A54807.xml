            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>TO no others than you (fair Ladies) ought this Book to addreſs it ſelf, if it be true, that every thing does natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally tend to its proper ſphere. You will here find a Regiſter of your own Triumphs, it were therefore injuſtice to ſuffer theſe painted Sheets to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their luſtre from any other patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage than your bright ſelves. You ever prove exquiſite Artiſts in your own Profeſſion, and can with great dexterity varniſh over your imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb facs="tcp:60403:3"/>
whether natural, or caſually acquired in the exerciſe of your own Vocation: Your Author is ſenſible of failings in both theſe kinds, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he wants artifice to give his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, or adventitious parts a fair gloſs, to impoſe at once, as you do, on the eyes and underſtandings of men, he deſires your kind aſſiſtance to paſs his Ware as freſh, ſound and beautiful, becauſe it is with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible zeal conſecrated to your ſervice. Though I never had the honour to receive any marks of your favour, or to be ſignalized by wearing your badge, yet I have here boldly adventured to deſire your favourable Protection, as if I were an old Servant, that had loſt my Blood in fighting your Battels, and endured the fatigue of many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Sieges: if my ignorance does not permit me to pay my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in the uſual form; it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped you will accept of this Rhetorick, as an atonement for my want of Faith
<pb facs="tcp:60403:3"/>
and Charity at the Worſhip of your Shrines. If my youthful inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has hindred me from placeing your honourable Enſigns in the right place, where ſome people on the ſunny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Globe, do their Jewels: if I have not honoured you with a flat Noſe, pray be pleaſed (fair ones) to accept the Tribute of a flat Pen. It would however be a little hard to expect this rigorous duty of your humble Servant, becauſe I have weak E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and of Spectacles, which cannot be ſupported if once the Bridge were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. You have at this inſtant got the Maiden-head of my officious ſcribling Inſtrument, as you have ſome years ſince, the Virginity of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Quill. The Ink of this is black and ſmutty, but that of the other was of a more innocent and pleaſing colour; though after having been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by your converſation, it changed once its native Simplicity
<pb facs="tcp:60403:4"/>
for the variety of all the colours in the Rain-bow, or the greater diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a Peacock's Train. There is another difference between theſe two Alembecks: <hi>Bacchus</hi> makes the one to flow in exuberant and fruitful ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but he cruelly ſeals up the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mouth, that it cannot drop into one tear.</p>
            <p>I have wiſely choſe your protection for this Book, becauſe I would not be thought to expect the ten Guinea's Fee for a mercenary Dedication: All the world will clear this from any guilt of that nature, ſeeing it is directed to Ladies, who ſeldom expreſs their generoſity in theſe terms. I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thought it a piece of providence to make you patronize this minute Volumn, to ſave my Pen the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of acting the Sycophant in a long and nauſeous Epiſtle, according to the modern precedents. You have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of an Author, made your ſelves famous in the World: your
<pb facs="tcp:60403:4"/>
Vertues are conſpicuous to all Eyes, and palpable by all hands too: your perfections are the common Theme of the people, and your graces are daily expoſed to publick view. Who can enough admire your Chriſtian humility in being willing to edify with your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the dregs of men? your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability, in being all things to all men that come in your way? and your hoſpitality for opening your doors to Porters and Car-men? Your charity is ſufficient to cover a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſins, as diffuſive as that of the Sun, to every body that will appear abroad, or dares but once to ask the Queſtion; you are at all times inclined to mercy and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if your Votary will expreſs his ſorrow in a golden Tear. The Bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Sacrifice is the laſt part of this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, and ſtill ſubſequent to the rich oblation: but which is moſt of all, your Chaſtity is no leſs remarkable than your other Vertues. Your Luſts
<pb facs="tcp:60403:5"/>
and Carnal affections are wholly mortifyed, and you are become by your induſtry and fervent applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as inſenſible of ſenſitive plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as if you were made of Wood or Stone: ſurely you have in this particular, out-done the ſevereſt Moraliſt, or the moſt Holy of the Primitive Fathers, who never could ſubjugate their Bodies to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree you have done, as not to be once prickt with the Thorn in the Fleſh. You have methinks taken the ſame courſe to arrive at this meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious piece of ſupererogation, as the Fruiterer does to ſave his Raiſins; He makes his young Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice ſurfeit at his firſt dayes ſitting behind the Counter, that he may be ſure to have no guſto that way for the future.</p>
            <p>I proteſt (ſweet Creatures) to you ſtored with all the moral Vertues, and not deficient in one Theological Grace, ſaving that you may ſeem ſometimes
<pb facs="tcp:60403:5"/>
to want Faith: Some think you ſhould believe your Cuſtomers on the Credit of their word, after having received good ſtore of their ready Money. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this you look on things with a providential Eye, as Rats do the fall of a ruinous Houſe, or a rotten Ship: you can foreſee the downfal of any Servant, and leave him, as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſometimes does, to himſelf. Whilſt the Gentleman is willing to purchaſe the Soil at any rate, you ſuffer him to ſow the Seed; what he commonly reaps, you are beſt able to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of: and he that would grind with you, muſt pay the Toll before hand, even before he is permitted to bring his Griſt to the Mill. However if you are a little void of this believing qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, if you have no large proportion of faith, you are ſo well ſtockt with good works, that you may be excuſed the want of this unactive Grace. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has been in all points extream kind to you all, that are indeed ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb facs="tcp:60403:6"/>
a part of her own Sex; ſhe has been more than partial in endowing you with ſuch capacious talents, which the ſcantlings of our curt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings can never reach. Poor ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant man can ſcarce penetrate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a ſuperficial diſcovery of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Fountain of Knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you are Miſtreſſes: and by a ſtrange unheard of Parodox, thoſe precious mines of ſolid learning are in your tender virginal years moſt inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the beſt efforts of feeble man.</p>
            <p>The Author hopes you will not treat him after your uſual manner, but that you will excuſe him from that rigorous impoſt you exact of Strangers, and admit him into the Pit without the neceſſity of coming with a golden Ticket. If you become free of your amorous careſſes, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to regulate himſelf to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Proverb, which forbids us to look a gift-Horſe in the Mouth. He ſays, he'll take you all for fair, vertuous,
<pb facs="tcp:60403:6"/>
and honeſt; tho in ſo doing, you your ſelves will ſwear he is troubled with a very adventurous and implicit Faith, large enough for himſelf and you too. If the following leaves do ſupply the room of a Pack of Cards, to increaſe your Tribute, by cheating the loving Gameſters; it is hoped you will grant me liberty to trade, though I cannot properly as one of your body politick, yet very well as an interloping Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant. This is a Priviledge the meaneſt poetical Dawber claims from both the Theatres, who poſſibly never appears on the Stage after his own night, nor ever thought of, unleſs by the baulkt Bookſeller: if I have merited no better of you than ſome of theſe Gentlemen do of the Stage, may I be eternally baniſhed your <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus,</hi> may I dye anathematized in a full Convocation of the <hi>Trading La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi> and laſtly, may <hi>Whetſtones-Park</hi> ſcorn to ſave my longing, with the favour of a ſingle Kiſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60403:7"/>The only way I know to ſave the credit of my green Quill, is to make it reſemble as much as poſſible thoſe patterns of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that are made the ſubject of the following Diſcourſe. A little of that ſharpneſs you inſpire into your Lovers <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, would give my periods a grateful reliſh: and a ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of that Mercury, you procure for the Salivation of your faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, would ſublimate my fancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the feculent dregs of matter, which at preſent doe ſtrangly retard its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But why ſhould I borrow any of theſe tranſcendent qualities from your amorous Slaves, ſeeing they have them but at ſecond hand; they are in them but a faint reflection of that light, the Fountain whereof ſprings from the charming centre of your Microcoſm. My laſt Prayer ſhall therefore be, That as I have choſe you for a Theme, ſo I may in all points imitate theſe fair I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's; may every line be as poignant as an embrace of yours, and each Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb facs="tcp:60403:7"/>
like you, carry a ſting in its tail.</p>
            <p>In fine (Ladies) it is hoped, I have like a faithful Dedicator done your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and my ſelf what right, the rules of Juſtice and Reaſon could preſcribe. I have been only wanting in two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars eſſential to a Dedication, thoſe are flattery, and fragments of Latin or French Verſes: your modeſty ſo notorious to all the World, has ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded the one, and my own inabilities have ſaved you the trouble of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Since then it were a ſin to part Modeſty and Plain-dealing, nay im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, becauſe the moral Vertues are linkt together by a ſtrong Chain, I preſume you may be thought the fitteſt Patroneſſes for</p>

            <p>MEN do for the moſt part take the ſame meaſures, and are guided by the ſame principles of Fancy and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in their choice of Books, as in that of Women: for as the beauty of the one does in a great meaſure depend on the imagination of a generous Lover; So the other in like manner is forced to borrow

            <p>Who ever then would pretend with his Pen, to gratifie all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; whoever would aſpire to compoſe a Regal, adapted to every Man's palate, (I mean ſuch as have not loſt their taſt) muſt be ſure to have at all times theſe patterns of perfection before his Eyes, his lines

            <p>It were ſuperfluous here to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row any Arguments founded on reaſon, or the Authority of the Antients.

The beſt governed, and the moſt Catholick Cities now in the World, do grant it, if not a publick toleration, yet at leaſt a civil and ſufficient connivence. Many Men have been induſtrious to improve the Military Art, and
<pb facs="tcp:60403:11"/>
invent new ways of framing war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Engines; all which tend to no leſs than the ſlaughter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of humane Bodies: why ſhould it then ſeem ſtrange, or unbecoming to conduct poor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Women into the Road of knowledge, to acquaint them with the Rules of a Profeſſion conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, nay which has been found neceſſary in all Common-wealths and civil Societies of Mankind. But to be a little ſerious in my Apology, Every prudent man will be ſolicitous to know all the myſteries of this Trade, by the ill effects the ignorance of it has produced in others: that ſo being informed in the <hi>criterium</hi> of the unſound Ware, and the <hi>Buona Robba,</hi> in the differences of good and evil; he may thereby learn how to correſpond with the one, or at leaſt how to deteſt and avoid the other.

            <head>THE Introduction.</head>
            <p>IN <hi>England</hi>'s famous Metropolis, not far from the Piazzas in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> there dwelt a young and moſt beautiful Virgin: who by the poverty and indigence of her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents was obliged to one continued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement. This Fair Maid had ſcarce as yet that bleſſing of Providence ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in her perſon, who promiſed the Sun ſhould ſhine on all mankind, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide the diſtinction of good and evil. The want of ornaments ſuitable to her age, ſex and quality, were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſtrong enough to engage her in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60403:17"/>
this ſad and miſerable confinement: but alas! this fair Creature's Fate was yet much harder: ſhe wanted even that proviſion of neceſſary attire, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to repulſe the injuries of heat and cold. <hi>Dorothea</hi>'s Father (for ſo was the fair one called) had much more Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his Veins than Money in his Purſe; and for the ſupport of a numerous Iſſue, that angry Heaven had beſtowed upon him; there was nothing left, but the honour of his Family, and the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his own brave actions. It was his fortune, or choice rather, from the beginning of the late inteſtine broils, to have imbarqued himſelf in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s quarrel: the Eſtate his Father left him, and which had continued in his Family ſome hundreds of years had ſuffered the ſame rigorous deſtiny, that his royal Maſter had firſt undergone. So when <hi>Brutus</hi> had waſht his hands in that Sacred Blood; and when the true <hi>Auguſtus</hi> (for there needed no adoption) by the unanimous prayers and deſires of all his Vaſſals, had ſeated himſelf on his Fathers Throne, this Gentleman then expected ſome thing more than a return of the Golden Age: he thought
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60403:17"/>
there was ſomething due to the merit of his ſervices, that might have ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded a tedious attendance, and take away any neceſſity of turning ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, or offering up a begging petition; but what a wonderful and ſurprizing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment was it! when he thought his miſery had been at an end, to ſee a new ſcene of troubles appearing to him more tormenting, and more dreadful than the firſt. He began to think, the doctrine of invoking Saints, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing improbable, in that he had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented the neceſſity on't in his own perſon. His attempts proved notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding equally inſucceſsful that way, with his former endeavours: in as much as he wanted a Golden ſacrifice to molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Saints Heart: finding then theſe <hi>Paraſites</hi> deaf to all his intreaties, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable after all his Prayers; he is finally reſolved to make a bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack on <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf; from him he found a reception full of mercy, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and generoſity, even like the Fountain from whence it flowed: but there caſually happened a fair <hi>Danae</hi> in the way, that received ſome part of the Golden Shower, and intercepted for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60403:18"/>
ſome time the rays of that ſacred influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. This unfortunate Gentleman's miſerable Family had occaſion much more to yawn, for want of Bread, than exceſs of Sleep; and were forced to be very frequent in bleſſing themſelves, leſt the Devil ſhould enter their Bodies, as being for the moſt part defenceleſs, and empty Houſes. The revolutions, Philoſophers talk of on occaſion of a <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum;</hi> rather than ſuffer which, angry Nature would invert the Univerſe; were oft-times found true in theſe unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py perſons, who in their empty Guts found the effects of natures wrath in a horrid grumbling, and an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry confuſed noiſe. The Peripateticks give us to believe, if two Walls were placed oppoſite to one another; and the Air extracted from between them, Nature would in an inſtant bring them both level with the Ground, or make the two Walls meet, and lovingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace each other: By all which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume they mean no more than this, and what is ſignified in the vulgar Proverb, That the nature of a hungry Belly has a mighty antipathy to Stone Walls. The Male part of this diſconſolate Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60403:18"/>
by divers Arts and Shifts to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in that ſpacious City, made it their buſineſs to avoid theſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and griping hardſhips: but poor diſtreſſed <hi>Dorothea,</hi> her ſex not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting her to keep her Brothers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in their frequent ſallies, was of the reſt, in the moſt deplorable ſtate: ſhe wanted it ſeems, a neceſſary point of Faith, being equally deſtitute of Food and Rayment. The preſſing wants this Virgin had undergone, had ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently armed againſt all <hi>Cupid</hi>'s darts, and all the dangerous effects of love; <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> the eſſential ſupports of an amorous flame, had been hitherto this fair Maids implacable enemies; what ſmall favours ſhe had received from that Rural Goddeſs, had ſuch a ſtrong mixture of Gall and Wormwood, as too too much imbittered the benefit, to deſerve the tribute of a mean thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. Among all the Gods and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes, <hi>Thetis</hi> only remained her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and faithful Friend, and her ſhe payed in her own Coin with daily offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of ſacred Veſtal Tears.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60403:19"/>One day (and it was that dedicated to St. <hi>George,</hi> and by us particularly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in memory of our great Kings Coronation, whom Heaven preſerve) was the penſive <hi>Dorothea</hi> left alone in the Houſe to contemplate her own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and misfortune; She ſtood at a Window that lookt into the Street, which yet ſcarce afforded her ſight the benefit of the paſſing objects, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt choaked up by a jealous wall that engroſſed the fair <hi>Dorothea</hi>'s looks, hindred all that paſſed from the enjoyment of that charming viſion, and deprived the unfortunate Maid of oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to gratifie her eyes, the only ſenſe, ſhe was then in a condition to pleaſe: In this Melancholy poſture was the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Virgin conſtrained to reflect on her ſelf, and not without an inexpreſſible anguiſh of Soul, to ruminate on her cruel Fate. After a million of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thoughts, and ſome ſhowrs of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious tears, her pitiful but juſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (as ſhe ſince told me) burſt out in theſe or the like expreſſions: <q>If ſomething of Chriſtianity, or poſſibly my Parents Inſtructions did not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent influence my Soul; I ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60403:19"/>
at this inſtant exclaim at provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and fly in the face of Heaven. I would boldly approach the Almighty's Throne, to know what one action of <hi>Dorothea</hi>'s life, has merited this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid penance, this complication of miſery and pain; but ſince I am taught and commanded ſufferance, where there is no room for patience; ſince I muſt believe and expect the beſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all hope ſeems taken away: ſince I am obliged to think Juſtice an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial attribute of the Divinity, though I experiment nothing in my own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but a cruel ſeverity: ſince after all I ſtand engaged to look on the ſtrokes and Thunder that has fallen on me, as the effects of Heavens favour and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as deſigned for my future bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and preſent amendment; I will, I ſay if this muſt be made a part of my Creed, follow the example of other unhappy mortals, who becauſe either they will not, or dare not openly aſſault Heaven, make to themſelves a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs of Fortune, whom they firſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe blind, and thence make the mark of their rage, fury, and malice: Is it then from this inſenſible Divinity that

our whole Sex remains accurſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to ſubjection, and called by the other part of mankind, light, giddy, capricious and unconſtant? but whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does my perplexed imagination hurry me? would Heaven, or let it be Fortune, my ſufferings were no greater than what are the ordinary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on my own Sex; it is ſome eaſe and ſatisfaction in affliction, not to be the only ſufferer: it is an aſſwage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our pain, to have companions in our miſery: The Yoak becomes leſs galling when many draw, and the burthen more ſupportable when divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and placed on many Shoulders. Unhappy <hi>Dorothea!</hi> how wretched then and deſperate is thy condition? thou haſt been from thy Cradle adjudged to a nauſeous and ſolitary confinement, without any ſharer of thy ſorrow, any to have compaſſion of thy miſery, any to whom thou mighteſt impart thy miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, ſave theſe rugged and ſavage Walls, as deaf, as inſenſible as thy cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el deſtiny; and laſtly condemned to bear on thy weak Shoulders, <hi>Atlas</hi> like, a world of inſupportable miſery; thou certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haſt never yet enjoyed the benefit of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60403:20"/>
a guardian Angel, or tutelary genius, which ſome think is deputed to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the affairs of every particular indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual; or if fortune has granted thee that only mark of her favour, it is ſurely one of her own ſtamp, ſtupid, blind, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and inſenſible; if he had but once lookt on his charge with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident or a tender eye, he had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtifled <hi>Dorothea</hi> in her Mothers womb, or given her a charitable ſtroke in her unhappy Cradle: he has it is true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended her from all theſe dangers, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her from the thouſand ways infancy would undo it ſelf, but his care has proved the height of barbarity, and his charity the greateſt plague incenſed Fortune could pour on the head of the diſconſolate and wretched <hi>Dorothea.</hi> Ah! how oft have I prayed my Fate that I might ceaſe to be, that ſo I might ceaſe to be unfortunate? How oft have I deſired to loſe that only mark I enjoy of Fortune's bounty? would ſhe would pay her ſelf with her own gift, and leave me in a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility to forget the benefit; but me ſhe treats like a monſtrous malefactor, like a delinquent of an extraordinary
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60403:21"/>
ſize. I deſire to dye, but life is preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a part of my puniſhment; I have begged the uncharitable ſiſters to ſpin out my thread no longer, to cut it in the midſt, but am forced to breath, in ſpight of all my prayers, all my tears, and all my endeavours.</q> Scarce had the bright Maid ended theſe words, when a knock ſhe heard at the door, made her break off her ſolitary enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and for a time interrupt her doleful Plaints: Glad ſhe was at the opportunity of this diverſion, to find occaſion to wipe her eyes, and ſtop her tears, or at leaſt of diverting the current another way. A little, or a great deal rather, of chat is the life of Women, the fifth element on which they live, and which they can as indiſpenſably want, as the air they breath, or their neceſſary daily bread. The Reader may hence conclude, <hi>Dorothea</hi> was not ſlow to open the door, and inform her ſelf who it was that came to make ſuch a charitable viſit; ſhe ſoon diſcovered, it was one of her own Sex, that ſeemed ſo loaden with years as to be ſcarce able to ſupport the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; ſhe had very near as many fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in her Face, as Hairs on her Head,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60403:21"/>
her Eye-brows were thick and hoary, her eyes appeared the moſt fruitful parts about her, ſending forth a certain yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low matter, not unlike that which Hawks mute at one ſeaſon of the Year. there was an uninterrupted communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between her Mouth and Noſe in the outſide as well as within, held by means of ceroſe humours that conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtilled from one to the other; her Breaſts appeared like a pair of Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, without the leaſt particle of Air within, and which had hung ſome Ages in the ſmoak of a Chimney; her Chin was acute and bending upwards, as if it longed to kiſs the under Lip; it was graced with about a dozen hairs pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced much after the ſame order they are in an old Puſs, only they were not ſo pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, but rather reſembled that moſs or down, which may be ſeen to ſprout from a Dogs T—d. I hope the Reader will ſupply her other parts with his imagination by the taſt I have given of thoſe expoſed to view, if he is pleaſed to fancy her Skin of the ſame colour, with half-tanned Leather, or her Legs, a pair of Broomſticks cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Parchment, that had lately ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60403:22"/>
ſome injury from the fire, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume he may do the old Lady no mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt injuſtice. Her Nails were certainly viſible, and were much of the length of thoſe that are preſerved to tune an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Harp: for tho' ſhe came in a good orderly dreſs, yet ſhe happened that day to have put on a pair of Gloves, I ſhould call them by another name, but cannot think on it, that never had been furniſhed with Fingers: and ſo her tallons were laid open to every eye. <hi>Dorothea</hi> ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it was one ſhe never before had ſeen, but could notwithſtanding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in her countenance the marks of ſorrow and diſcontent; ſhe concluded how buſie ſoever Fortune had been with her, ſhe had been likewiſe diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her ſelf at the expence of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Woman: but the injuries ſhe had received from Fortune, were not, ſhe thought, ſo viſible as thoſe large chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters time had imprinted in her face, as the marks of his impartial, but cruel hand. After <hi>Dorothea</hi> had conducted the old Woman into the Houſe, and thoſe ordinary civilities had paſſed that may be ſuppoſed between two ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers at the firſt interview: the aged
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60403:22"/>
Matron addreſſed herſelf to <hi>Dorothea</hi> much after this following manner.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Character I had of your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (fair creature), of the endowments of your mind, and withal, the ill cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of your preſent condition, have brought me this way, and into this place: I am come to lay before you the unhappineſs of the ſtate you now live in; what you muſt expect if you perſiſt therein; am willing to ſhew you the fitteſt remedies for your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, am ready to afford you my beſt advice, and if you be not wanting to your ſelf, to put an end to all your miſery and trouble.</q> I need not here (neither indeed is't poſſible) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſatisfaction <hi>Dorothea</hi> received at the hearing theſe bleſſed tydings: ſhe returned her thanks in the beſt terms ſhe could then deviſe, adding, <q>That her misfortunes rendred her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly capable of receiving kindneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which ſhe would at all times gratefully acknowledge.</q> Then the old Woman proceeded thus, <q>It is without peradventure (ſaid ſhe) one of the greateſt misfortunes that can befall a young Lady, either to be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60403:23"/>
ignorant, or not to have fit opportunities of improving her tender years, ſo as may moſt conduce to her future ſatisfaction, benefit, and advantage, to ſpend thoſe precious hours in a melancholy and drowſy ſolitude, in which it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned ſhe ſhould reap that harveſt of content in the open Fields of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which love inſpires, and Heaven pours down for the delight of youth; is, I ſay, to pervert the courſe of nature, to oppoſe thoſe benign influences ſhe was born under, and to be induſtrious in procuring her own miſery and ruin. The niggardly and covetous Miſer has been ever condemned by the univerſal ſuffrage of all mankind; in that his wealth ſerves only to feed his own eyes, and is never permitted to ſee the Sun. The ſame guilt does a fair Virgin incur, in an equal degree does ſhe injure the publick, who being Miſtreſs of large poſſeſſions of Wit and Beauty, does hide thoſe precious talents, and conceals that ineſtimable Treaſure, from whence the principal part of mankind might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably expect ſuch infinite ſatisfaction. That perſon does certainly deſerve ſome thing worſe than ſlavery, who having
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60403:23"/>
been for many years detained in a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did confinement, ſhould refuſe or ſlight the offers of a generous friend, that would have paid his ranſome, broke his chain, the mark of his ſervitude, and placed him in an honourable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſtation. 'Alas! replyed <hi>Dorothea,</hi> how unneceſſary are your arguments to one in my ſtate? if you have already diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing in my perſon your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs calls a valuable treaſure: if you can prove ſo good a Chymiſt as to extract thence any eaſe to me, or ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to any part of the World: if your charity diſpoſes you to break my Chain, and relieve an unfortunate Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; you ſhould preſuppoſe in me ſuch a willingneſs to comply with your kind propoſals, as might ſuperſede the neceſſity of any perſwaſive.</q> Then the old Dame in the moſt inſinuating and gilded terms, palliated with a <hi>Decorum,</hi> ſet forth the neceſſity there was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her beauty to ſale, and become a Woman of the Town. She told her that liberty was the firſt and the greateſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of nature; that the old World had not been circumſcribed by any of thoſe political Laws, which the craft of Prieſts
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60403:24"/>
and cunning of States had introduced to abridge the World of that ſatisfaction which variety of love affords mankind. She magnified the pleaſure, ſtate and pomp enjoyed by Whores, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable felicity there was in a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Lovers and Idolaters: that ſhe was to expect deluges of gold and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good things this World affords, if ſhe would carefully obſerve thoſe Rules ſhe would lay before her. That every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Votary would come as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did to their Temples, with rich oblations of the better part of their wealth. Our youthful years are, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe, that golden Age ſo much talkt of by the antient Poets; and which ought to be ſpent in as great variety of pleaſure, as Gold is malleable into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of forms. After we have plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully taſted of thoſe inexpreſſible ſweets that love diſpenſes, it is then, and not before, a fit time to imitate with chaſt manners the purity of the Silver Age: or experiment the rigours of the Iron one, under the auſtere rod of a cruel Husband. <hi>Dorothea</hi> had already been inſtructed in the School of neceſſity, to know this was the only remedy, left to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60403:24"/>
remove the cauſe of her preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper. The ſenſe ſhe entertained of her birth and quality, had made her at all times reſolve againſt any mean or contemptible Service, the extravagant deſire ſhe had of a change, and not being able, or poſſibly not altogether willing to anſwer the reaſons alledged by the old Seducer, ſhe at laſt yielded to the powerful efficacy of the Hagg's charms, without being once able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke honour to her aſſiſtance, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the aid of her own reputation. The only obſtacle that now remained, which retarded the full conqueſt, and made her for a few minutes ſuſpend a final and abſolute ſurrender of her ſelf; was the conſideration of her own ignorance, in the affairs of the World: this created in her ſtrange fears and jealouſies of being unfortunate in the exerciſe of her intended Trade, which required an honourable begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and appearance in the world, and in which a Lady ought to be preinſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in a ſyſteme of the moſt curious frauds, and the moſt winning blandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; if ſhe would ever expect to bring her buſineſs to a happy concluſion,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60403:25"/>
or arrive at any degre of an advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perfection. Theſe difficulties ſhe propoſed to her new Miſtriſs, as the only <hi>Remoras</hi> that ſtopt her longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to condeſcend to her opinion, and give her ſelf wholly up to be guided by her. Then the old Lady took the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to remove all doubts and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in words to this or the like effect.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Daughter (for ſo muſt I call you) the kindneſſes I had for your perſon, even before I was acquainted with it, upon the bare fame of your merits, the pity I entertained for your ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and the tender affection now created by my own choice, and thoſe extraordinary qualities I have already diſcovered at this firſt encounter, have I ſay, raiſed in me ſtrong deſires to ſee you move in a higher ſphere, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a ſtation of uncontrouled felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; I am very well able, and yet as willing to inſtruct you in all thoſe neceſſary precepts, and acquaint you with thoſe excellent rules, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal forms by which you may become expert and famous in this Art. I will in a few days diſcourſe illuſtrate unto you the <hi>Whores Rhetorick,</hi> in ſuch
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60403:25"/>
a plain and an eaſy method, and paint it in ſuch lively and charming colours, that you will be conſtrained by both profit and pleaſure, to learn, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and apply to uſe my ſhort but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Documents.</p>
               <p>Be not ſurprized that under theſe mean appearances, I ſhould cover ſuch a ſtock of knowledge, imprinted in me not only by a long ſtudy in the theory, but likewiſe by many years experience in the infallible practick part. I my ſelf in my younger years, was one of thoſe the World calls a <hi>Lady of Pleaſure;</hi> and even in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this profeſſion, in my moſt lively and licentious days, I applyed my ſelf likewiſe to the ſtudy of polite Learning. I ſoon arrived at a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perfection in my own Trade, and in a little time was valued as one of the firſt rate Whores, for the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of my Lodgings, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ornaments, for a graceful and ſtately behaviour, if not on the ſcore of an agreeable and a handſome face. The memory of my paſt grandeur, ſerves now only to increaſe my pain: and it is but the juſt reward due to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60403:26"/>
the non-obſervance of convenient rules I was not then ſo wiſe as to contain my ſelf within the bounds of a Rhetorick; my vain curioſity tranſported me into the wild and unpaſſible mazes of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and to dive too far into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of natural Philoſophy to gratifie my own fantaſtical and giddy nature. I fell in love with a diſſolute and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs fellow, (Ah Daughter! this is the accurſt bane of our Sex, but thoſe eſpecially of this Vocation) with whom glutting my ſelf in extravagant pleaſures, I fell to diſcuſs the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and compoſition of the Heavens in practiſing delights, which to me ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much more pleaſant than the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of the Spheres. Then I advanced to the Books of Generation and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: and finally paſſing to the aery abſtracted notions of Metaphyſicks, I found all my Money exhauſted, and reduced to a meer Chimera, in ſearch of thoſe vain and empty Dreams; ſo that at laſt I was reduced to theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical ſpeculations, and even almoſt forced to preach up Charity, as a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, I was conſtrained for ſome time to live on: but finding people for the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60403:26"/>
moſt part extream cold in the exerciſe of this Grace, I ſoon quitted the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and betook my ſelf to a more gainful and more acceptable imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 'I am ſorry (good Mother) ſaid <hi>Dorothea,</hi> ſmiling, that your curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity has been to you of ſuch fatal conſequence; but though you have not in all points obtained your ends, though you have not yet perfectly found out the Philoſophers Stone, you have, I am confident, made ſuch accidental diſcoveries, as may ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently make amends for all your labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inquiſitions, and ſatisfie all the reaſonable demands of any moderate Scholar. My ſlender knowledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms me, I ought gladly to build on the experience you have ſo dearly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, and reſt ſatisfied with ſuch practical Doctrines as you ſhall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to impart unto me; without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining any Metaphyſical affections, I ſhall acquieſce in a knowledge of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary beings, and ſuch of thoſe only, as may afford ſome profit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as well as pleaſure. I will not be ſolicitous to underſtand what ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the Heavens are made on; nor
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60403:27"/>
to gratifie my ears with the Muſick of the Spheres: the ſweet melody created by the ſound of the Golden Oblations you ſpoke of, centring in my Purſe, is a ſound which I preſume ought to afford me principal ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and I ſuppoſe all my induſtry, and all my policy ought to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the acquiſition of this profitable Science. 'But pray Mother (continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Dorothea</hi>) after ſuch mighty miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes as you had ſuffered, when you were by the loſs of your Money re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the contemplation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity? where was it you then found ſhelter? what Shore were you caſt on after ſuch a dangerous Shipwrack? 'Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I anſwer any queſtions of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that may interfere with our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent buſineſs, you muſt firſt give me leave, my dear <hi>Dorothea,</hi> to applaud the comment you have given my words, and thank Heaven for having found in your Perſon a diſciple after my own Heart, to whom I may, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leave this World, leave all the choice ſecrets of my Soul, all thoſe Sovereign Receipts, which being by your care and induſtry judiciouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60403:27"/>
according to the ſeaſon of the year, the nature, quality and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the Patient, will infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly produce marvellous effects, and make you more famous in after ages than the <hi>Corinthian Lais,</hi> or the other Lady of the ſame name, that cauſed <hi>Perſepolis</hi> to be ſet on fire.</p>
               <p>It is the greateſt happineſs that any mortal is capable of, to be inſtructed in a prudent conduct, and ſage ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of their affairs, by that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which was not gained at firſt without many hazardous adventures, and a multiplicity of certain dangers. I have already ſhewed you the fatal rock on which was ſhip-wrackt my grandeur and reputation; and I hope the experience of errors may render the truth of my Doctrine more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and the validity of my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons more authentick. When the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of Youth, and an inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of gratifying my appetite, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to neceſſity or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, had ſwallowed up my pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial faculties; then it was I committed thoſe indiſcreet miſcarriages, which I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60403:28"/>
could never retrieve but with ſorrow and repentance. When my fooliſh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections had overflowed all thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable paſtures, and ſafe paths, which diſcerning reaſon had chalkt out for me; when the ſpring-tide of my paſſions, had covered the tops of the higheſt rocks, and made the face of danger as ſmooth and calm as that of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; then it was that with all my Sails, running before the Winds of Plenty and Pleaſure, I irrecoverably loſt the Ship of my repoſe: and glad I was to get to ſhoar on the two planks of Miſery and Want. After this ſad diſaſter, when I had ſacrificed my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to appeaſe the inſatiable cravings of a bawling <hi>Neptune;</hi> when I had loſt all hopes of being ever able to Rig out a new Ship; and when the number of my years could ſcarce per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to undergo the fatigue of a new Voyage; I begun then to think it high time to ſettle my ſelf on the lazy ſhoar of eaſe and temperance. I had ever been in the Spring of my years, one of <hi>Cupid</hi>'s moſt zealous Votaries: and though impotent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had diſabled me from perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60403:28"/>
any conſiderable ſervice in the fields of love, otherwiſe than by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſive in the work; yet my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable part, the Will, did ſtill retain its primitive heat, vigour, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; as an old decripit Souldier, who having received many dangerous wounds, and honourable ſcars, and is now unfit to give a perſonal atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in the field, yet by his long experience in the Wars, is able at a diſtance to win a Battel by his prudent and unerring Rules; and getting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf carried up to the top of a lofty Tower, he there ſits basking before the Sun, feeds his eye with the ſight of the numerous Battalions, drawn up in excellent order, and gratifies his ears with the harmonious diſcord of Drums, Trumpets, and the more warlike ſound thundred from the mouths of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, and all-deciding Cannon. Juſt ſo it fared with me in the warfare of <hi>Venus:</hi> I could not without infinite regret quite abandon that beloved ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and ſeeing I could not be princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal in the action, I was reſolved to be ſomewhat more than acceſſary by my ſervent advice, and bold encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60403:29"/>
Thus then I turned Natures hand-maid, and a Midwife to love, which had often proved abortive, had not my importunate prayers and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations brought it alive into the world, to the infinite ſatisfaction of the loving pairs. It is now about thirty years ſince I began to ſerve the publick in this charitable imployment, and had ſtill continued ſo to do, had not a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Jury diſpoſſeſſed me of my lovely habitation, I had for many years kept in <hi>Moor</hi>-Fields, to the joy, comfort, and ſupport of the whole amorous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <q>'Ah Madam! cryed <hi>Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi> interrupting her, how cruel have you been in concealing thus long your name, and thereby hindring me from paying you thoſe reſpects that are due to the fame and quality of the Lady <hi>Creſwel?</hi> how obſcurely ſoever I have ſpent the few years, I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy paſt, it has not been without fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently hearing of your name, the place of your abode, and the cruel ſeverity you have of late been forced to undergo.

all your perplexity and ſorrow, as well as the miſery of my own ſtate, I ſhall be extream cautious to avoid all dangerous curioſities, as well as any dangerous and unprofitable amours. I will make it my principal care to ſuck in thoſe wholeſome Inſtructions your Rhetorick ſhall furniſh me withal: I will be wary not to exceed thoſe bounds and limits which you ſhall therein be pleaſed to preſcribe me; yet I will withal be more than induſtrious not to come ſhort, nor fail in the punctual obſervance of all your injunctions.</q>
               <q>Fair Daughter, replyed the old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, (who muſt be called hence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Madam, Mother,</hi> or plain <hi>Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> as the caſe requires) 'you may I am ſure, diſcover evident ſigns of joy and comfort in my countenance, at the hearing your wiſe and diſcreet remarques: I begin to think my good fortune has not utterly forſaken me, foraſmuch as I have great incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to believe your pregnant and towardly genius will prove a bleſſing to my declining, and become the ſtaff of my old Age. Seeing you are ſo well prepared to receive my inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60403:30"/>
I will loſe no time, but will forthwith expound unto you my pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Rhetorick, in the eaſieſt and plaineſt method. I will take care in five days to rig you out, and ſettle you in a convenient place, where you may ſee variety of good Company, and be inſtructed in ſome neceſſary parts of converſation: for this and the fixing my preſcriptions deeply in your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, I will allow you ſome months, as many as may ſeem neceſſary to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you perfect in theſe qualifications, which are abſolutely neceſſary, before you may be permitted to open your Shop. You will peradventure be a little ſurprized to hear me talk to you of things, that cannot be attained without ſome conſiderable coſt and charge: let not that in the leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb your thoughts, how cruel ſoever my enemies have been, they have ſtill left me ſufficient to ſupport the ſmall remainder of my days, and withal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to gratifie my own humour in ſhewing you theſe inconſiderable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. I have at this day ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and eminent Debtors, who have been the Kings Lieutenants, Lord-Mayors,

and Sheriffs of the City of <hi>London:</hi> ſome of them have indeed made me but ingrateful returns of all my favours; if they did believe love ſtill ſo valuable, as when they were my conſtant gueſts, they would be juſter in paying their debts, and more mindful of their old Friend. I ſhall not, ſweet <hi>Dorothea,</hi> detain you any longer in the Porch, but ſhall with much impatience expect to morrow Morning, when I will return hither, and in a ſhort time illuſtrate unto you a perfect ſyſtem of ſuch neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, on which, if duly obſerved, you may lay an infallible foundation for the ſuperſtructure of Riches and Honour.</q> I muſt here profeſs my inability to ſhew the Reader that ſatisfaction, the young Maid received at theſe her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes laſt words: ſhe expreſſed her thanks in a low curtzy, and a ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive look: She only told her, The marks of her kindneſs were ſo great, ſhe was not able to expreſs her ſenſe of it; but ſeeing it was impoſſible to pay her in effects, ſhe would never be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on all occaſions to ſhew her grateful acknowledgments.

being deſirous to repair towards her own habitation, was about to take her leave, and bid her young Pupil good Night; when <hi>Dorothea</hi> remembring ſhe had ſomething to ask, for a few minutes retarded her departure, by deſiring to be reſolved in the following queſtion. <q>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid ſhe, you told me, that after that unlucky miſcarriage in your amours, when your good fortune and riches had been ſplit on the rock of credulity, that you choſe of all profeſſions to turn Superviſor of Love; I deſire then to know, Whether there be any kind of a fatal neceſſity, that all Whores ſhould terminate their days in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; I hope, Mother, the ſimilitude of the old Souldier does not run on all four; for indeed methinks, I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver endure to ſee thoſe delights practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by others, which I my ſelf could not enjoy; it would be to me, I am confident, an exceſſive torment to be tantalized with thoſe ſweets, I were never to taſt.</q>
               <q>Heavens forbid, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered old <hi>Creſwel,</hi> that ere my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Jewel ſhould be expoſed to the diſquiets and inconveniencies of this ſlaviſh drudgery, time will not now
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60403:31"/>
permit me to ſhew thee the myſteries of this profeſſion: at a convenient oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, I will either my ſelf, or get one of my younger Siſters to inform you in the moſt material tricks and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pans practiſed by the Bawds of this Town: ſome ſmall knowledge in this affair will be expedient to preſerve you from their numerous frauds: whilſt I live, I will be ever at your elbow, to ſecure you from danger, and if thou diligently obſerve my precepts, thou wilt have reaſon to bleſs the Fleſh and the Bones of thy old Mother, and to love me after I am dead, as I believe you may have good grounds to do as long as I live. But I had almoſt forgot to anſwer your pertinent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; which I ſhall do in telling you there is no manner of neceſſity you ſhould diſquiet your thoughts, with the vain fears of being one day obliged to undergo that weighty charge, which I have near thirty years born on theſe weak Souldiers. If I had not been a diſſolute ſpend-thrift, I never needed have loſt my own liberty and repoſe, to procure that for others in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60403:32"/>
meaſure: if I had regarded my own profit, or advantage half ſo much in my green years, as I did the pleaſing my fantaſtical humour, I ſhould not have forfeited my eaſe in my old age, to gratifie licentious youth in all its capricious and extravagant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. But you, Daughter, I promiſe a more advantagious fortune: you ſhall never need turn Bankrupt in love: when you have laid up a plentiful ſtock for the ſupport of all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingences of this life, and miſeries of old Age; when you have plentifully taſted all the varieties love can afford; when you are cloyed with pleaſure, and grown weary of venereal paſtimes, you ſhall call in your debts, clear your accompts, and ſhut up Shop; like a Uſurer, who is grown old and tired with cheating, who has quit both Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change and Coffee-Houſe on the ſcore of buſineſs, only repairs thither ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for his conſolation to rail at the Government, and ſmoak a Pipe. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you have ſuffered ſufficient drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Pulpit, you ſhall rowle into a fat Biſhoprick, and there pamper
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60403:32"/>
your ſelf in Prelatical pomp and lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury. When you have ruined a million of unhappy Clients, that have thruſt their cauſe into your hands, and got a maſs of Money, by bawling, cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lying; you ſhall then wrap your ſelf up in lamb-skins, and take a nap on the lazy Bench. When you have acquired a plentiful Fortune, by deſtroying many Legions of wretched Patients; it will then be a good time to leave of killing, and oblige poſterity with ſome choice Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts. Finally <hi>Dorothea,</hi> when you have for a good number of years imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the Courtier, in cringing faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſupplanting, and undermining, and been quite jaded with acting <hi>alla Cortegiana,</hi> that is, both the Whore and Courtier, you may with pleaſure retire to a Country Houſe.

               <p>There is a mighty neceſſity, Daughter, that you in all points conform your ſelf to thoſe obligations your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion will impoſe upon you in ways far different from the ordinary artifices of our Sex. We are all, it is true, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclined to weave fraudulent webs, and to be likewiſe overjoyed at the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of our experiments: but a Whore ought to exceed others of her Sex in theſe undertakings; as many degrees as her opportunities of knowledge, are greater, and her neceſſities of living by ſuch ſubtleties may ſeem to require. She moves in a higher ſphere, than the reſt of Women; and her actions ought to ſeem publick-ſpirited; though Stateſman-like, ſhe ſhould contrive them all to meet in the centre of her own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular advantage: You muſt be furniſhed with great variety of words, and even thoſe that are moſt familiar and trivial, to enable you to entertain your Lovers on all ſubjects: ſtill complying in the choice of the matter with their various tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. This part of Rhetorick is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to fit you on all occaſions, to uſe ambiguous expreſſions, and for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſometimes, ſynonymous terms;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60403:37"/>
to equivocate, vary and double, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your fancy and the preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: all which do extreamly enhaunce the value of your words; and add a particular gallantry to your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. A Whores language in the laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious dialect, is ever to pleaſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent lover; who always coming to feed on the ſame diſh, ought to enjoy the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of diſcourſe, in ſuch ſort that he be not cloyed with his fare, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence ſhe loſe the efficacy and main end of her eloquence. You muſt ſeem altogether inſatiable in pleaſing your lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and in multiplying his delight; ever pretending to receive therein your ſelf particular ſatisfaction; if his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has taught him divers forms in the enjoyment, gratifie him in condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his humour therein: provided his particular generoſity challenge this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular treatment. During theſe raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing minutes be not wanting to afford him a multiplicity of ſtrict imbraces: let your careſſes, and ecſtaſies be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inclining to violent, ſometimes ſlow and remiſs; but ſtill ſuch as may ſeem natural, without any artificial conſtraint, that ſo he may believe you
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60403:38"/>
raviſhed beyond your ſelf: and be thought, not only to feed him with your body, but to have given likewiſe your very Soul. Let this be attended with ſome dying words, ſoft murmuring ſighs, as may be juſt overheard by your lover. Redoubling the knots of hands and feet, let the Comedy end with ſome ſweet kiſſes, in which let your tongue gently glide within his lips; that you may ſeem to have tranſmitted your Soul that way; whilſt he infuſes his, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, at another door. After the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, be very induſtriou to drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that repentance, or melancholy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which naturally ſucceeds fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: to hinder him from nauſeating thoſe delights, even for the ſpace of one minute; on which depend the main force of all your perſwaſions. It will not be amiſs, during this intervall, to divert him with an aery Song, or ſome jocular, and facetious Novel, that may remove all marks of ſadneſs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him for a ſecond aſſault. When he is ready to depart, has payed for his pleaſure (for that I ſtill ſuppoſe) and you expect no more of his liberality for that time, be ſure to diſmiſs him with
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60403:38"/>
ſome extraordinary Epilogue, that may ſoon enforce a return; let your kiſſes be on this occaſion more ſavory than uſual, and your dalliances ſo exquiſite as may create in him ſtrong, and invincible deſires, to buy more of your fruit, tho' you ſhould be ſo cruel as to raiſe the price. Thoſe are ſtill eſteemed the choiceſt, and are ever the deareſt cakes, which do not cloy the Stomach; but only whet its edge, and prepare it for a new meal. Promiſe him the next time greater ſatisfaction, and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious fare; make him believe the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures you diſperſe are ſo refined and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualized, that they will always im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove by a repetition, and increaſe in proportion, as they become familiar by frequent practice. Give him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand your Treaſure is inexhauſtible, and that you will never want ſufficient reſerves; being thus intangled in the net, he will fancy himſelf always a Priſoner, but when your ſoft hands looſe the knot, and make him free; he will believe every Hour an Age till he may ſatiate his longing appetite, and revive his Soul with the delicacies of the ſame repaſt. Men are oft of opinion, that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60403:39"/>
Women were made only for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment; ſo by conſequence they will too frequently deſpiſe them when the pleaſure is over, as they do meat on a full Stomach. Conſider then how near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it concerns you to know ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary arts to engage your Lovers, and make them indiviſibly yours (if I may ſo ſay) even after the act of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. Your graces muſt be ſtrong, and your charms irreſiſtable to oblige them to continue their converſation; which muſt after a time redound to your profit and advantage. Uſe all men and at all times with terms of the higheſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, a feigned kindneſs, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended affection can ſuggeſt: unleſs ſome particular diſobligation may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the contrary; and then let your reſentments be ſhewed in a ſtately and ſcornful contempt; but this I will only allow, when all hopes of further gain are taken away; when your Votary has hardned his heart, not to be reclaimed by reaſon, nor diſſolved by tears. With thoſe that are your familiar and conſtant Cuſtomers you muſt learn a particular deportment. When you find your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion imparadiſed in pleaſure, drowned in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60403:39"/>
exceſs of love, and now ſcarce able to bear the weight of the joy, it will be then fit you ſhould experiment the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of your well regulated note, inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſome conſiderable requeſt, for the which you muſt never want ſome plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pretence: at one time you ſhall feign that ſome of your moveables of value are pawned for a ſum of money (which muſt be proportioned to his temper and ability) which if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by a certain day, then at hand, will be irrecoverably loſt; at another time, give him to believe the loſs of a Pendent, Ring, or ſuch like utenſil, for which you have a ſingular value, not for the thing it ſelf, but leſt you ſhould be thought careleſs of the Donors favour who muſt be ſome particular relation, whom you would by no means diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige. You may ſometimes complain of an obligation that lyes upon you, to pay a debt at ſuch a day; ſeem ſenſible of your preſent diſability, and the damage your credit will receive thereby, your creditor being one of your main bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors. At another opportunity you muſt put on a borrowing face, but with a firm intent to make no reſtitution. If
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60403:40"/>
your lover have a retentive faculty, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with proteſtations of good will, and excuſe with impotence, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of effects; put him fairly to it by way of being ſecurity: and be ſure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to want a friend on thoſe occaſions, that will lend money, having a hint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, of the ſtanchneſs of the perſon he is to have as ſurety; with theſe and the like inventions, you muſt ſtrive to keep your Purſe, and ſupply the contingences of any extraordinary charge: For all theſe purpoſes take care your Maid be wiſely pre-inſtructed, to ſhew her Miſtriſs wholly diſintereſted, who, ſhe is ſure, would not ſtoop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath her <hi>decorum,</hi> to make any ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, were not her kindneſs and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity the occaſions of it. It will be neceſſary your Servant ſhould know on occaſion to act the buffoon, or at leaſt many capricious and pleaſant humours: that ſo under the notion of burleſque, all things being permitted her, ſhe may by way of jeſt, uſe her earneſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to fleece the Rivals: her deſires muſt be either moderate, or more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant, according to the diſcretion of the amorous gueſt. Some are pretty
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60403:40"/>
well, or perniciouſly rather, armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Whores wit: and dare be ſo hardy, to reſiſt all the ſhocks of her importunities: but much the greater number, are prone to yield in all theſe points if diſcreetly managed; and not a few ſo weak, as to be impoſed on by the Legerdemains of a Servant. Above all things ſee that your ſnares be not detected, before you have caught the Woodcock; for if the net be foreſeen, even thoſe ſhallow Animals can avoid the danger. What ever is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by theſe means may be reckoned as clear gain, in regard the purchace comes in without trouble; ſo it is try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mens generoſity and good nature: when ever a repulſe happens in the way, ſtep lightly over it without any apparent regard, or the leaſt trip. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty in all traffick; one that will build on no leſs than infallibility, wants faith, and muſt never expect any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable return: but ſhe that can run the riſque, who can look danger in the face, with a favourable gale, may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at ſome degree of eminence, and come off with multiplyed gain. The Documents are good, but yet the rules
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60403:41"/>
of commerce are voluble: in as much as there are variety of contracts with the like variety of Perſons, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to meet at all times; one and the ſame humour: however Daughter, be ſure to trade in the bank of ſubtilty, that ſo your caſh may ſtill increaſe, and your profit advance agreeably to your own deſires.</p>

Fancy your ſelf ſubjugated by an inevitable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to ſatisfie any the moſt laſcivious appetite, provided he comes with Gold in his Purſe, and is willing to purchaſe at your rates. You muſt forget the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Gentleman, and Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick; but let men be divided in your Books under the names of Poor, Rich, Liberal, and Niggardly. I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have you only ſeen with firſt rate Gallants, in the face of the Sun, and in publick places, but under the ſhelter
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60403:41"/>
of darkneſs, and covert of the night, lowre your Sail, and condeſcend to the embraces of inferiour perſons, who have oft-times a larger Fond, and are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er induced to comply with a Ladies hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. The Emperour that raiſed a Tax from Piſs, to confute one that thought it beneath and inconſiſtent with the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Prince, produced a heap of Gold that came into his Treaſury by that Impoſition; <hi>Does this,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſtink of the excrement whence it was drained?</hi> Thereby ſhewing, that money removes all ſtench, from the meaneſt action, by vertue of its purging quality. Carry your ſelf at all times with a ſuperficial ſtatelineſs, to gain reſpect, and avoid contempt: but remember to bate ſome degrees of this gravity, if it either may offend, or be diſcovered by a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Lover. You muſt in your Cloaths appear beyond all meaſure rich and magnificent. Young ſparks (nay and ſome that have arrived at years of diſcretion) do judge of one anothers Wit and Parts, by their dreſs and garb: ſo they ever conclude a Woman's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractives to increaſe, with the glittering of fine Cloaths, and ſumptuous Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60403:42"/>
Though I am ſure the Coxcombs are almoſt equally aſtray in both parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: I would have your Cloaths ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeem grave than gawdy, yet ſuch as may in their ſplendour ſhew ſomething of the fantaſtical, and notwithſtanding preſerve a <hi>decorum.</hi> Thoſe Whores are very ill adviſed, and do ever in ſhort time become crackt and bankrupt in their reputation, who for the humor of ſtrutting about, and to be thought frol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickſome, brisk, and gay, do deviate from the ſtrict rules of ſobriety, they ought to obſerve, into a contrary exceſs of lewdneſs and obſcenity: they hereby precipitate themſelves into open danger, and loſe their aim, which was thereby to gain upon their amorous Servants, by falling into open contempt, becauſe impudence was of the ſame ſtamp. She ever ſells moſt Ware, and at the beſt rate, who can handſomely ſhew its worth, but yet does not ſeem too fond of the Buyer. Men will be ſure to reſpect thoſe moſt, who ſet a high value on themſelves, and their own goods. They deal with Women as they do with their Habberdaſhers; let the Shop be in a gentile part of the Town, have a fair
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60403:42"/>
outſide, let the Seller be well ſtored with Shop-Rhetorick, and then he that asks moſt, is certainly eſteemed to vend the beſt Commodities. But on a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing veneration for Piety and Religion, eſpecially before Strangers, whereby you will be ever valued even by thoſe that have themſelves laid aſide thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations; but much more by Men of generous and free thoughts. By no means give your ſelf the liberty of Swearing, or drinking to exceſs; unleſs on ſome particular occaſion, a young Bubble may encourage you thereto, who is free of his money, and in love with thoſe inſipid and unprofitable vices. As to the various modes of fine dreſſing, Singing, Niceties to be obſerved in Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Drinking, Behaviour and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; I have already told you, that ſome time is to be laid aſide for the learning of theſe, before you can ſafely begin the World, all which you muſt be inſtructed in at another School.</p>

You may reſt aſſured that no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable return can be expected by dealing with one Correſpondent (I do not now ſpeak of thoſe whom ſome perſonage may keep for his particular diverſion) it is the height of folly to depend on the ſupplies of one Purſe, the inevitable ruin of a Whores Fortune, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible prologue to a ſtate of beggary.

It were much better to comport with a matrimonial Chain, voluntarily to ſell your liberty to one Husband, whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and money may be more at your command, than can be expected from an amorous Friend, who muſt needs be tired with your continual wants, and nauſeate your many importunities: but if his hands did not grow weary of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant disburſements, if his inclinations ſtill continued to ſatisfie all your neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, the mines would be finally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and as the expences would grow greater, the power and ability would daily decreaſe. Thoſe are only the famous Rivers in the World that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the tribute of a multitude of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Brooks; and the Ocean it ſelf could not brag of its vaſt extent, and unaccountable limits, if its ſupplies were not unaccountable likewiſe.

over you to ſuch a height, as to tread you under his cruel Feet, and with ſevere blows command you to bury all your demands. If for want of opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities a Woman ſhould be conſtrained to defend this dangerous poſt; or at her firſt appearance on the Stage, ſhe ſhould not be able to eſtabliſh her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, by a numerous train of admirers; let her be ſtill on her guard, and cautious not to miſs laying hold of the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient refuge, but ſtill with diſcreet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, keeping in her own hands the power to retract, at the firſt offer of a favourable gale, that may waſt her over to any other more advantagious Port. In a change and variety of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, you will find occaſion to improve your skill in Rhetorick, which in the centre of one mans Breaſt, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual handling one particular matter, would become trite, loſe its efficacy, and yield you neither profit nor even pleaſure it ſelf. A ſingular dexterity will be always neceſſary to keep, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the peace among the jealous Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, to maintain them affectionately devoted toward their Miſtriſs's ſervice, and ready to comply with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60403:44"/>
talents. You muſt fancy your ſelf ſupream Governeſs of an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Republick. The merit of your Subjects muſt be valued in proportion to their wealth, and their readineſs to open the ſtrings of their purſes: ſo you ought to be nicely impartial in diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting rewards and puniſhments according to their ſeveral merits, or prevaricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which in your Law muſt mean, generoſity on the one hand, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive parſimony on the other. Still encourage loyalty, and an humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in all your Vaſſals: pour down the largeſſes of your favour on thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of whoſe fidelity you are well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, and who prove ready at all times to ſacrifice what is moſt dear to them, to your will and pleaſure. It is a fooliſh maxim to oblige your enemies, or ſtrangers, by fancying your ſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of your friends Hearts. This piece of policy would certainly ruin you in the end, and leave you deſtitute of all ſupport. If there happen to be any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on whom you may think fit to ſhew particular marks of your bounty, or whoſe ſervices have merited ſome ſignal reward, be careful not to give
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60403:45"/>
him any diſtaſte, or any juſt ground of diſcontent, let this be the infallible <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terion</hi> of your ſervants affection, if he acts in your ſervice, with more regard to your intereſt than his own particular advantage. Be not wrought on by the impudence or importunity of any baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling fellow, to part with the leaſt part of that Treaſure, which ought to be wholly reſerved to recompenſe your zealous Servants, and your old friends. Be mindful in a particular manner of thoſe, who ſtick to you in any adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, it is a ſure ſign they are diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted and fond of ſhewing their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. (He was certainly a coward, and no wiſe man, the Emperor, I mean, that firſt introduced the cuſtome of reclaiming grand Mutineers, with heaping honours on their undeſerving heads; and ſtopping the mouths of the factious with preferment in the ſtate. This is to open a wide gap, for every neceſſitous, or adventurous Villain to enter the bewitching Fortreſs of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: and whatever Potentate fancies this the ſafeſt way to reduce ſuch to their duty and allegiance, is guilty of the ſame ignorance and weakneſs; that

You muſt not be unprovided of the <hi>Whole Duty of Man, Practice of Piety,</hi> and ſuch like helps to Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as having been from the beginning a great pretender to Religion. Order it ſo, that he may ſurprize you in a zealous mood, in the midſt of an ejaculation, and not without your eyes overcaſt with tears: he will certainly ſhew his affection in being extreamly inquiſitive, to know the ſource of your tears, ſorrow and diſcontent: pretend at firſt, unwillingneſs to trouble him with a diſcovery; but after he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled his importunities, ſatisfie his curioſity, and remove the miſt from before his eyes, by hood-winking him
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60403:48"/>
with this or ſome ſuch anſwer. <q>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, my dear, (ſhall you ſay) but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a very ſignal misfortune, and one of the ſaddeſt circumſtances of my whole life, to be guilty (if I may ſo ſay of the innocent) of contributing in any degree to your diſquiet, or the diſturbance of your, ſo much by me deſired, repoſe. As I have for the time paſt, ſince I had the honour to know you, ſo I ſhall for the time to come, and with my laſt breath, wiſh you all imaginable ſatisfaction. Nature, my own choice, and the eſſential obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I owe you, thoſe large marks of your generous temper, have made me totally and eternally yours. I find in my ſelf the genuine effects of a ſympathetick flame, if by that be meant a ſtrong, a violent, or a ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs paſſion: but if ſuch as is created by no known cauſe, or wherefore no reaſon can be aſſigned, then I muſt confeſs my affection thus far will not correſpond with the name of ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. It is however, much to be feared, that I am now arrived at a dangerous precipice. I love you, and muſt ever do ſo, though my own reaſon and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60403:48"/>
the dictates of Heaven tell me, I ought to break off this impure communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and demonſtrate my love in other more lawful methods, and more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our holy Faith. And yet the flame within me is ſo ſtrong, and has in it ſo much of a violent ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, that it forcibly prevails over all the faculties of my Soul, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven deprives me of that liberty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I thought, had been grounded, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the hopes of reward, or fears of puniſhment. It boldly triumphs over my reaſon, drowns my Faith, and baffles even thoſe ſupernatural aids, that ſhould enable me to overcome all the moſt dangerous difficulties: In fine, Sir, I am torn in pieces between love on the one hand, and fear on the other: between the force of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the ſtronger powers of an immoderate paſſion. It is from you then, and only you I may hope for relief, it is you that can cure me of my pain, that can prove the Phyſician of my Soul, as well as body; and it is you I conjure by our mutual flame, our paſt joys, your own goodneſs, and my tears to commiſerate the

               <p>Thou haſt undoubtedly read <hi>Cleopatra, Caſſandra, Pharamond,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of that nature, which I proteſt I never did, and ſo from thoſe Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Ladies mayeſt ſay ſomething more heroine and gallant than what I can at preſent ſuggeſt. Tell him it would be more inſupportable than a thouſand deaths, to be bereft of the bleſſing of his converſation. Beg that he will ſtill permit thee to enjoy the ſight of his perſon, without thoſe impure effects of his love. That you will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſatisfied to ſerve him in any mean capacity, and think it a higher felicity ſo to do, than to live with any other man upon Earth in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of a married Wife. I tell thee again, Child, my crazed fancy cannot ſoar ſo high, beyond the Planets, as it ought at this time: my old <hi>Minerva</hi> wants the encouragement of a quartern of Brandy to ſpiritualize it for this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60403:49"/>
But faith, <hi>Dorothea,</hi> if thou wilt be adviſed by me, tell him in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> if he will not make thee his in an honourable way, deſire to be excuſed from ſupplying any longer the room, and place of his Whore.</p>

Madam, knowledge is at leaſt an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to every body, and will be ſo to me though I ſhould have ſuch a fortune as not to put all your inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in practice.

               <p>I would fain know, Mother, whether a Lady, in this caſe, might not take now and then the liberty to divert her ſelf with other Lovers, that may probably be more pleaſing to her than the maintaining Gentleman: For I fancy he may become in time as troubleſome as an impertinent Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>

               <p>That is a nice point, Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Variety is indeed the Soul of the World; and I would not be ſo cruel to confine a young Creature to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of one man, no more than I would to one Diſh of Meat, or one Petticoat. But then, Daughter, it is more than neceſſary to be well aſſured of the perſons diſcretion, whom ſhe truſts in an affair of this conſequence. There is not one in twenty, that is able to conceal his conqueſts; for men do take more pleaſure in divulging their
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60403:51"/>
good fortune, than they did in the very actual enjoyment. They can indeed rail at Women as weak and frail Veſſels; and yet they themſelves are rather more leaky; being as little able to keep an intrigue of this nature undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, as they are to keep their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the day they have put on a new Suit: a diſcreet reſervedneſs is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary, and to be ſtrictly enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into, in regard ſo few are maſters of it.

               <p>Are there no other qualifications requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in an amorous confident, beſide diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and generoſity?</p>

               <p>As to thoſe that live at large, other meaſures, and different ways of proceeding are neceſſary to be known, they are daily to encounter a multitude of various humours, and ſo of courſe, accidents of the like nature. Their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and Trade being univerſal, their cunning and induſtry ought to be ſo too. And indeed this general acquaintance, this multiplicity of experiments, is the readieſt way, after the foundation of a good Theory, to make a Whore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in her own buſineſs, but without that, unleſs, I ſay, ſhe have imbibed ſome ſpeculative notions, and been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in ſome preliminary Doctrines, ſhe muſt fail in the practick part, turn Bankrupt in a ſhort time, and then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that long ſeries of Miſery, which uſually attends broken and neglected Whores.

Let the Whore imitate the Lawyers Chriſtian Patience, in ſuffering any ſcurrilous abuſe, ſo the Libertines Purſe be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to atone the miſcarriage: I would have her likewiſe give her Client a fine ſtory for his Money, as the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer ſerves his; and laſtly let her be ſure to hate a poor Lover, as much as the Lawyer does a <hi>pauper</hi> Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>

               <p>The moſt convenient habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a Trading Lady, is in a ſmall convenient Houſe of her own, rather than in Lodgings. For in theſe ſhe will be ſubject to ſeveral Rules, which in a Houſe all at her devotion need not be ſo much feared. If ſhe lyes at a place of any credit, it will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſhe ſhould obſerve ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable hours; then her ſecret intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues will be more liable to a diſcovery, when pryed into by a whole Family, than if communicated to one or two Maids, that depend on her ſelf, and are her own Creatures. But the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and main inconveniency of Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings is, That in them it will be difficult to contrive ſeveral ſmall Chambers, or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60403:53"/>
dark places of refuge, juſt large enough to contain a Bed, which may be eaſily had in her own Houſe. The uſe of theſe is very great to conceal, and entertain at once ſeveral Lovers: That while the Maid ſtands Centinel, to expect, and give her Miſtriſs warning of ſome jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Servants arrival, ſhe may have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſatisfie with a ſhort repaſt, and a haſty bit, the hunger of another, who will content himſelf with ſuch a ſottiſh enjoyment, and pay as much for this ſtollen fruit, as if he purchaſed in the open Market. There are not a few of this temper, who love to ſteal theſe joys, and think them more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable than thoſe they obtain with freedom and priviledge; as School-boys love one ſtollen Apple above twenty fairly come by with ready money. There are a ſort of Gentlemen, that are eaſily gulled into a belief of their being the ſole Favorites, and who are only admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Ladies bed. Theſe youths are naturally free of their money, and therefore deſerve a ſingular manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Whore ought to anſwer their zeal, in all the demonſtrations of a feigned affection: ſo when the Spark
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60403:53"/>
comes to cool his heat, when ſhe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in another adventure, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a new Servant, the ſaid retreats and lurking holes will ſtand in principal ſtead. I knew a Whore (whether more bold or cunning I cannot determine) that uſed thus to lodge two or three Gueſts in her ſeveral apartments; he that paid beſt was of the moſt jealous temper, and whom ſhe was moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to diſoblige, was the perſon to whom ſhe would engage her ſelf for the Nights diverſion: ſo after immoderate riding, beſide perhaps the occaſional in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive of ſome Bottles, had lulled the wearied Traveller into a profound ſleep; then would ſhe pay her reſpective Viſits, and ſatisfie the ſeveral exigences of all her Friends. Theſe by places, theſe dark Conventicles, for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the family of Love, are more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over extream neceſſary, for both the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical and the cowardly Lover, him that thinks to cheat the eyes of Heaven, as well as thoſe of the World; and him that loves the ſport, but believes it unneceſſary to appear in the Fields of <hi>Venus</hi> with drawn Swords, and who thinks a treat of love never the more
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60403:54"/>

               <p>A Lady that uſes this ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, ſhould make her private Lodger believe, ſhe has only in her own Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a preciſe Female Friend, or ſome ſuch pretence: but as I was ſaying, Theſe two ſorts of men are always to be led blindfold into one of theſe amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Cells, and though there were no need of this wary and ſevere conduct, yet it is neceſſary to make it ſeem ſo, by magnifying the danger they would both incur, if their commerce were found out by her keeper, who muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented either a fighting Blade, or one that loves to expoſe reſerved and ſober Lovers. On ſuch terms the Cullies will pay any rate for a reſerved entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and think they arrive at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pitch of felicity, when they meet a Whore that pretends to love a ſecure privacy, and diſcreet to mannage them according to their ſeveral failings. Such Squires will be credulous enough
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60403:54"/>
to believe this circumſpection is all but neceſſary: ſo their appetites muſt increaſe as does the Ladies caution; and her dainties ſtill the higher prized, the more ſeeming difficulties there go to the purchaſe: beſide this, they may be made condeſcend to any terms, to wait of their Miſtriſs at her hours, receive her aſſignations as may beſt ſquare with her convenience, how prejudicial ſoever to their own; and will finally remain full well ſatisfied to get with Foot in Stirrop, one haſty imbrace; and having once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, will ſtreightway turn tail, as do the barbarous Moors after the firſt vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, not daring to abide the ſhock of a ſecond encounter, like brave Chriſtian combatants. They will perſevere in their liberality, to procure a ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the amorous theft, much more, ſo they might be permitted to feed after the manner of the Country Mouſe, without fear of diſturbance, or danger of the Bullies rude viſit, to make up an unwelcome ſecond courſe. This the Whore muſt ſtill fairly promiſe, but ever as ſlow in the performance, proteſting ſhe will ſtudy all means to ſecure a long entertainment, giving them by little
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60403:55"/>
and little larger hopes; ſo gradually draining their Pockets, ſhe ſhall at length feed them with the proſpect of a whole Nights regal. She may render her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes more plauſible, and her preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more authentick, by ſhewing that her Guardian is ſoon to take a progreſs into the Country, where he intends to make ſome conſiderable ſtay; that then all things will naturally tend to their mutual pleaſure and content; ſo the good man will live on theſe fancies, and leſt he ſhould be baulked of his hopes, will be ſure to keep the jeſt warm, and alive with ready Money. Theſe are the bleſſed minutes that bring in the golden Tribute, that diſſolve theſe facil Deities into plentiful ſhowrs, with a ſhort and an eaſy prayer, an empty and vain promiſe. Several of theſe intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues may be carried on every day, in that they conſume but little time, and do ſcarce admit of any impediment. Special heed muſt be taken to avoid confuſion, which muſt be done by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſting aſſignations to her beſt advantage and opportunity: and having ſtrong ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes at hand, to apologiſe for any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental or neceſſary failure. Let her
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60403:55"/>
call one of her Cuſtomers Brother, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Unkle, a third Couſin, that ſo the converſation of ſuch being without ſuſpicion; this may ſerve on occaſion as a good reſerve, to remedy any inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience that may happen from a jealous Servant, when ſuch Friends are caſually ſurprized, or taken napping in the Houſe. It will be expedient that ſome of theſe Relations ſhould ſometimes make their viſits, as if by accident, when they know the paramour is ingaged with his Lady; who having civilly paſſed ſome time in an indifferent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, ſuch as may beſpeak conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity, and then formally taking his <hi>congé,</hi> with a, good night Couſin; will hereby juſtifie the Whore's ſincerity, and for the future remove all ſhadows of doubt from the formerly ſuſpicious Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The pretext of being married may draw Cuſtomers, if well carried on of her ſide, and if ſhe can likewiſe light of a looſe fellow, who will not be wanting in playing his own part. I need ſcarce mention in this Rhetorick, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity a Whore has of keeping a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and ſtrict correſpondence with ſome particular Bawd; it being a thing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60403:56"/>
ſo well known, and univerſally practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Theſe Brokers are as neceſſary in love, as the Spaniel to the Sportſman, firſt to noſe out the game, and then to drive it into the Net, or cunningly to ſurprize, till the Whore draws the Net over, and all fear of eſcaping is taken away: and then too they will Spaniel-like, if the Whore be not expert at her Trade, be too nimble for her in ſeizing the prey, and taking to themſelves the firſt pluck. It will not be amiſs howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to conceal her keeping intelligence with theſe Emiſſaries, but eſpecially from thoſe they intend to poſſeſs with a belief of being kept, married, or a hater of multiplicity of amorous careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. When a young Woman is often ſeen in company of any known ſhe-Scout, every body will conclude her buſineſs is great, her deſigns general, and that ſhe intends to prove a latitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narian in Love. I would have her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Bawd, a certain proportion out of every pound acquired by the old La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies induſtry and negotiation; And not any certain ſallary by the Month, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Year; for ſeeing that were to be ſtill the ſame, ſhe might prove negligent
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60403:56"/>
and remiſs in her Embaſſies: but when her gain is to increaſe proportionably with her own diligence, abundance of expedition may then be expected, and frequent returns of plentiful and ſecure profit. Herein imitating a diſcreet Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who thinks it more for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to allow the Pilot a ſmall ſhare in the Cargo, than a certain monthly ſtipend: wiſely conſidering though his life be concerned in the welfare of the Ship; yet the hopes of lucre, are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more regarded than even the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of life it ſelf, and may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably add more to his vigilance and care, than that firſt natural principle of ſelf-preſervation. When the Lady and her inamorato meet to Sup at the Bawd's Houſe, (which muſt not be neglected, if ſhe would not incur the old Dames diſpleaſure, and endanger a rupture) ſhe muſt not be wanting to find ways of enhanſing the reckoning: what ever Wine the Spark likes, the young Lady muſt make ſome pretence for diſliking the ſame at that time; I am ſure the old one will be for a third: and the like rule being obſerved in eatables, variety of Wine and Diſhes will eaſily mount be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60403:57"/>
parting to a round ſumm. If there be an Oyſter-Woman within half a mile, ſhe ſhall be commanded from her Poſt, and pre-inſtructed to paſs by the door at full cry, and if not called in by order of the treating Squire, to enter without invitation, opening one or two of the Cock-Oyſters, (which ſhe knows better by half than a Jockey does a found Horſe) ſhe will tranſgreſs the rules of good manners, in ſerving the Gentleman before the Lady, becauſe forſooth, it is he muſt pay for the peck. So according to the ſeaſon of the year, and what is moſt grateful to the old tooth, occaſions will be found to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the ſeveral retailers, and the modeſt Lover no Chriſtian liberty left, of ſaying yea or nay, but (to invert the vulgar ſaying) is forced to receive all whether Fiſh or not that comes to the Net The ſame method is to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and larger opportunities of ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are then to be found, when the pair of Lovers lye all Night at the Bawds Houſe.</p>

               <p>Some have, and ſome have not. And that happens as the Bawds buſineſs and ability concur. Theſe amorous Inns ſometimes are furniſhed with all neceſſaries in Love, good Wine, neat Chambers, and delicate Beds. It is the cuſtome in ſome of theſe for the Lady Procuratrix to furniſh the Whore alſo; ſo for Lady, Supper, and Lodging the hungry gueſt may pay without any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, a certain ſum to the Miſtriſs of the Family: but then in this caſe you may believe, there will be no variety, as when the Gentleman does not ſtipulate in any certainty, but brings his Miſtriſs along with him, and pays according to what he calls for.</p>

She or he that intends to ſharp on a Bawd, (I will uſe that word) muſt get up before <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and be ſtored with more cunning, than was
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60403:58"/>
the old Serpent that cheated our Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother <hi>Eve.</hi> They have all exerciſed the Whores Function, whilſt any mortal man would give them leave, by joyning in the buſineſs. And even after many years practice of Bawdery, (I ſpeak experimentally) they are over-joyed, when any rampant youth, overflowed with Wine, to ſhew the greatneſs of his courage, and ſharpneſs of his Stomach, will for once cure their Itch, by rubbing their ſuperannuated Tails. Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> Child, ſays well, that Wiſdom is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but experience; ſo by conſequence the Bawd muſt ſurpaſs all mankind in point of Wiſdom, in as much as her experimental knowledge does exceed all others. She has read more Men than any mortal has Books, ſhe has ſpent more oyl and more pains in queſt of knowledge, than the moſt laborious of the antient Philoſophers; and has been more unwearied in her nocturnal elucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations, than the moſt ſevere of the old cloyſtered Monks. Let my Scholar then be adviſed by me, who is now grown old, and full of years in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of both faculties; that it will be prudence not to aſpire to this inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60403:59"/>
point of knowledge; the Bawd will ever prove too hard for her in the Politicks, though ſhe invoked Hell to her aid. Let it ſuffice her to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the old Rooks falſe Dice, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her ſelf from being paſſive in the cheat: if ſhe aims higher, to reach at the forbidden. Fruit, ſhe muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to reap knowledge thereby; but will only diſcloſe her ignorance, and make her nakedneſs viſible to her ſelf and others.</p>

               <p>Next to theſe love Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes now ſpoke of; it is fit my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple ſhould make it her buſineſs never to want an intereſt in thoſe Houſes, where foreign Embaſſadors and other Strangers of quality lodge. Among theſe there is never wanting good ſtore of Gold, nor a number of Woodcocks, that will with open Eyes fly into the Net. It may be an argument ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to gain her a reputation, in the opinion of theſe Gentlemen, to pretend they are not to be admitted without a mighty privacy, her carriage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct being lookt after with a jealous eye, that ſhe might forfeit her dears kindneſs by taking this liberty: his generoſity muſt be exalted at this time, that ſhe may not ſeem to act out of a principle of neceſſity; ſo her careſſes will be more valued and rewarded in an extraordinary manner; as men are commonly at grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expence in a Gentlemans Houſe, than a publick Inn. The ſame rule may be uſed to good purpoſe with ſome of her domeſtick acquaintance. She will find it much to her advantage, to enquire particularly into the ſtate and quality of all her Suitors affairs, to hinder any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60403:60"/>
or ſurprize: for if ſhe has well informed her ſelf of their buſy hours, and when the neceſſities of their vocation, or the impulſe of pleaſure, do oblige their attendance; it will be eaſy to appoint times of meeting, as may give general ſatisfaction, and enable her to obſerve her particular engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This enquiry into the condition of her Lovers may be in another reſpect of no mean uſe. It is hard to know a mans temper from the lines of his Face, or any other extrinſick mark; and it is no leſs difficult to give a Judgment of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or eſtate, by his ſpending, or the figure he makes in the World. Some Men are for this day, and let to morrow provide for it ſelf; others look on fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turities; remember the precedent of the Ant, in providing againſt a wet day. Some imitate the Snail, I do not mean in their gate, but in carrying their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on their backs; others are ſolicitous to ſatiate their Bellies, and a third to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh his Purſe. A Whore then ought to underſtand Men in all theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to avoid contracting a familiarity, or making any ſtrict alliances with ſuch as live beyond their bounds, and promiſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60403:60"/>
in ſhort time to become Bankrupts. This were an unneceſſary precept, if I could ſuppoſe my Scholar, upon her guard on all ſeaſons and hours: for then ſhe might be truſted to deal with any extravagants, who are the beſt Friends, and the moſt generous Lovers, whilſt the Fond laſts: and therefore are for a time extreamly neceſſary; but when they break, it is almoſt impoſſible for a young Lady not to ingage her ſelf in their ruinous fortune. So that it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſuppoſe a Woman frail in this caſe: Daily experience, and the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of many credulous Whores, do evince the truth of this. They find their Gallants in the beginning of their amour, for the moſt part kind and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; but in a few Months acquaintance, familiarity will (if the Whores diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion do not prevent it) blunt the edge of both, or at leaſt the Squires want will produce the ſame effect. Let her then be acquainted with her Lovers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to know how long his ſtock will laſt, and when it may ſeem reaſonable to diſcard him; which muſt be punctually put in execution, the firſt minute he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes neceſſitated to fail in his uſual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60403:61"/>
unleſs ſhe intends to bring, not an old, but which is worſe, an empty Houſe on her Head, and be forced to contribute to the ſupport of this uſeleſs and unneceſſary tool. When fortune deſerts the man, let the Whore do ſo too, without retaining the leaſt ſenſe of her old acquaintance, their mutual joys, or his paſt generoſity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dor.</speaker>
               <p>In ſo doing ſhe is but faſhionable, and does but conform her ſelf to the mode of the times, which I think a Whore ought always to obſerve, when publick practice and her own intereſt do joyn hand in hand, and run together in the ſame ſtream.</p>

               <p>She that expoſes her Soul and Body for gain is more than a fool, to be influenced in any degree, by either the obligations of Friendſhip, the Laws of Juſtice or points of Honour. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is requiſite ſhe ſhould on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions preach Doctrines quite contrary to what I have recommended to her own practice. She muſt make ſhew of being diſintereſted in all her actions; that not one look, kiſs, touch, careſs, embrace, flows from any other ſource than the pure Fountain of an unſpotted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60403:61"/>
When ſhe is in company of her ſeveral Admirers, an indifferent reſerved, and equal carriage will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, unleſs it be found expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent at certain times, to ſhew the moſt liberal and rich of the whole covey, ſome particular favours, whereby the others may grow jealous, and ſtudy to raiſe themſelves in her good liking by ſome extraordinary piece of gallantry. Privately let each one be the Dear, and the Beloved: and let her feign the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Lovers joys are ſingularized with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral prerogatives not diſpenſed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in that degree and quality. Let her pretend a mighty abhorrence to the embraces of many; and that ſhe nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates nothing in nature ſo much as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Proſtitute to the luſt of any, but him ſhe actually enjoys. This will improve the ſenſe of his pleaſure, make each bit go down with a guſto, and as it ſwells his content, it will at the ſame time enhaunſe her Tribute. Thus the conſort of her amours will never be found to jar, but ſtill in a condition to raiſe a harmonoius and ſeeming, if not a real ſatisfaction in their Souls, who come for the gratification of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60403:62"/>
ſenſes. I would have her forward on all occaſions, to proclaim the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of any Servant, both to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the continuance of it by this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit gratitude, and to excite others by this example to the like performance. This will be an infallible means to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort money from a wounded Lover, one who has folly enough to fall in love, and faith to believe a poſſbility of any kind returns; he will ſtrive to exceed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body in profuſe regals, not only to be reſpected in an equal degree with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but likewiſe to baniſh all other pretenders from her grace and favour; whoſe perſon he will hope to engroſs to himſelf by ſupplying all her wants, and removing all neceſſity of depending on other Lovers. If he be a youth of Fortune, one fit for a Husband, let her not fail to play her part at this time, with more than uſual dexterity. The ſame rules I have already given thee, will ſuite this occaſion, and if opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity be caught by the foretop, they will prove of force ſufficient to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the weak and negligent guard, kept by unwary youth: provided alſo a propitious fortune do concur in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60403:62"/>
If Matrimony do not enſue, let her however not be wanting to pluck the maſter Feather from the Gooſe-wing, and to ſhew her trophies to the next Bird that comes to the Net, to encourage him the more freely to part with his own: thus wheeling round in an eternal circle of fraud, ſhe will fulfil the Vows of Avarice and Diſſimulation, taken at her initiation; and ſoon place her ſelf in a ſtation beyond the reach of malice, or the ſtroaks of fortune. It is unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to preſcribe any farther Rules to drain the inamoured Cully: he will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf to be patiently fleaed, and ſo becomes rather the object of her pity, the diſhonourable trophy of an eaſy conqueſt, than the noble victim that withſtood the force of repeated ſtrokes; but fell at laſt a ſacrifice to the irreſiſtable power of a well laid counſel, and the magical artifice of a counterfeit look. With young Men, that have lately dropt from under a Mothers or a Tutors Wing; a Whores great work is at firſt, rather to captivate their Heart, than win their Purſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe enjoying the firſt, entitles her to an abſolute Soveraignity over the laſt.

A handful of <hi>Modeſty,</hi> a drachm of <hi>feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Piety,</hi> and a ſcruple of <hi>counterfeit Chaſtity,</hi> is a <hi>Recipe,</hi> with a <hi>probatum eſt,</hi> to intoxicate any tender Heart.

After the ill ſucceſs of ſome projects, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned rather by unlucky accidents than either her ill management, or the Eſquires diſcretion. She is at laſt reſolved to make
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60403:63"/>
her ſelf up to the Ears in Love, that ſhe can neither eat, drink, nor ſleep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the dear Creatures company: ſhe entertains him ſeveral times at her own Lodgings, preſents him with ſome toys of ſmall value, and never a Week paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes without ſome dying Letters conveyed to him by means of her truſty Maid, who at the delivery of each, harangues the Youth with her Miſtreſſes quality and vertues: and that ſhe had rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a thouſand deaths, than have her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation expoſed by a diſcovery of this epiſtolary correſpondence. She intreats the ſweet Boy to tear off the name <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

raiſed him much above himſelf, firmly believing all her proteſtations real, as if they had proceeded from the ſimplicity of his own heart, and that the charms of Perſon and Parts had made this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute conqueſt over the fair Lady. But withal her fondneſs ſlackned his reſpect, and the further ſhe proceeded in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of her flame, the higher he ſtood on his punctilioes, and at length arrived to that degree of familiarity (though not without a bluſh in his pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Cheeks) as to reach his hand toward the basket of fruit, which ſhe had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſhould be forbidden till the Parſon had tyed the knot, and given a bleſſing to their future endeavours.</p>

               <p>The noble <hi>Hiſtrio</hi> that day put on the face of a murthering Hector, though love was now his buſineſs; I will not be particular for fear of lying, but you may ſuppoſe it was <hi>Almanzor</hi>'s, and that in his ſtrain he ſpoke things that would have made <hi>Oroondates</hi> bluſh; but <hi>Almahide</hi> was that day cloathed with more than ordinary cruelty, and in her purple Robes was about to pronounce the Sentence of death, or perpetual Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, when the Bravo made his <hi>exit,</hi> in hopes, as he ſaid, That a gentler air would calm the diſturbed Ocean of her Brow: the ſame did the beautiful <hi>Endy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mion,</hi> with more than uſual ſtate, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his <hi>Luna</hi>'S paſſion confirmed by the undeniable teſtimony of his own Ears.

               <p>The next time the adamantine Lover came to pay his Miſtreſs a Viſit; ſhe gave her Maid orders to tell him her Lady was buſy, and could not be ſeen at that time. At firſt he thought it was but the Maids own humour, but as he
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60403:66"/>
was puſhing forward, ſhe ſomewhat rudely repulſed him with the repetition of the ſame orders. He marched off with his uſual gallantry; but not being called back as he expected, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently began to diſcover in himſelf the ſymptomes of ſorrow and repentance for his ſevere carriage to ſuch a fair and ſuch a paſſionate Lady. Thoſe thoughts he diverted with ſome pain, for that Night, being confident to meet his Miſtreſs next day in her uſual temper. But coming at his old rate the following Evening; all his hopes were daſhed in pieces, by a ſharp meſſage delivered him by the Maid, and a cruel Letter, ſuch as he never could have dreamed of, from ſuch a tender hearted and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Maid.</p>

               <p>I cannot particularly tell you, but I preſume a lively repreſentation of her juſt reſentments. However it was, the Youth found himſelf ſtruck with ſomething more than ordinary thunder, and greater confuſion than was <hi>Phaeton</hi> that day he fell from his Fathers Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box. With much ado home he got all in a cold fit, with liquid Eyes, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60403:66"/>
Joynts trembling, juſt as they would after a tedious and lingring diſtemper. He began to ruminate on this ſurprizing alteration, he found himſelf guilty in all points; he was his own Accuſer, his own Judge, and if his good genius had not hindred thoſe dire effects, he had proved likewiſe his own Executioner.</p>

               <p>The Lady appeared in his eyes far more lovely, and more raviſhing than ever. Her Fidelity, Vertue, and the Conſtancy of her paſſion, were ſo many Vultures, preying on his broken heart: in fine, he was reſolved to make amends for his paſt coldneſs, by the zeal and warmth of his future paſſion; and either recover his loſt bliſs, or follow his Brother <hi>Naroiſſus</hi> in the ſame or the like unſeaſonable fate. In theſe contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations he ſpent the whole night, in ſpight of <hi>Morpheus</hi> and all his <hi>Opium.</hi> As ſoon as Madam <hi>Aurora</hi> gave him leave, he called for Pen, Ink and Paper, and wrote to his incenſed Lady, the moſt paſſionate, moſt humble, and moſt peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall Epiſtle, that ever dropt from a Gooſe-quill.</p>

                  <p>THE conſideration of the ſiniſter fame that ſome ill Women ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our Sex, does at preſent whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confound me; who by their baſe treachery and diſſimulation, diſcredit the vertue and ſincerity of others. I am full of doubts and jealouſies, My deareſt life, that you do not judge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of my paſſion, elſe there would be a return on your part, you would think it juſtice to give me your heart in exchange for mine you are already poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of, at leaſt endeavour to retaliate
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60403:68"/>
the ardour of my affection, and eaſe a dying heart of the torture of a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning flame. Oh! Heaven protect me from the ſin of infidelity. I ſhall ceaſe to be a Woman, nay to be at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this can ever prejudice the deſire I have to be loved again. If incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy be inſeparable from a Womans Heart, I will deprive my ſelf of life, to abandon thoſe principles which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me unworthy of your affection, and make me an unfortunate Lover. Have you a care not to give way to injuſtice, cruelty, and ingratitude un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretext of any unreaſonable ſuſpicion; for none of thoſe ordinary failings can have any ſhelter, any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle in the purity of my faithful mind. If things ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon are likewiſe contemptible, and if it is the ſcarcity that makes things va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, my love can never be too highly prized, in that it is far from common, ſuch as is no where to be found but in the centre of my own Breaſt, and can never admit of any pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel. If I have in any degree tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed thoſe rules of decency, young Ladies have preſcribed themſelves, it
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60403:68"/>
is you, and you only, that could have been the Author of my miſcarriage. If you have made me forget the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates a ſevere modeſty would enjoyn (which I had yet hitherto preſerved inviolated) you ought not firſt to act the Seducer's part, and then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to inflict the puniſhment. I know the writing of this ſingle Letter, is a crime, for which I never can make ſufficient atonement, and yet I am irreſiſtably hurried on to the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of it. I clearly ſee thoſe plain, and ſafe paths, honour and prudence have chalked out for me, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my uncontrollable fate drives me on in the rugged courſe of a precipitate and indecent love. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then it is impoſſible not to love you, it is equally impoſſible my love ſhould be fictitious. You may aſſure your ſelf, there can be nothing Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh that is inconſtant in that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which has for its baſis the ſtarry firmament of your charming countenance.

Be not then inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, my pretious hope, after my tears and prayers flowing from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted ſource of your Adorer's Eyes, and that pure fountain of immaculate love, the unfortunate <hi>Catherina</hi>'s lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing and diſtreſſed Soul. I will again be guilty, by turning ſuppliant once more. Conſider then I beſeech you, my pain, of which you have been the ſole cauſe.

               <p>A Whores eloquence, as if it were an artificial compoſition, has no ſmall reſemblence to the Body natural: for it pretends to a diſtinction of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſome eſſential, others for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which chaining together the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral periods, render the work perfect, and intire.

               <p>I would not here preſcribe any ſet unalterable Precepts; becauſe the Whore ſtands obliged to alter in many particulars, and change her method as may make the deepeſt impreſſion in the capricious head of that Man ſhe is about to perſwade. It will be at all times ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to gratifie her Lover in the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Members, to place them in that part of the period, which may create moſt pleaſure in his particular fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Let her induſtriouſly avoid all harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ruggedneſs, eſpecially in thoſe parts that are more expoſed to the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers touch. A morbid ſmooth skin is one of <hi>Venus</hi>'s chief attributes, and one of the Whores moſt forcible arguments. As her Bed muſt be clean, ſweet and ſoft, ſo ought every part of her Body,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60403:70"/>
to make it a ſcene ſuitable to the delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of amorous joys, let her be curious in her Perfumes, Eſſences, and ſweet Waters, to procure the ſatisfaction of the ſmelling ſenſe; which will much advance her Lovers joys, and make her appear a compleat Sphere of delight and pleaſure. My Rhetorick muſt not be deficient in ſhewing the ſeveral ſlights, that may be fitly adapted, to captivate every Senſe of a Mans Body, and each faculty of his reaſonable Soul. She muſt be nicely clean in every action, and part of her life: not omitting to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance as much as poſſible, the natural whiteneſs of her Skin with the aſſiſtance of artificial means. An exquiſite night-Dreſs for the Head is a thing not to be neglected by any Whore, that would be abſolute in all her numbers, and one of thoſe Leſſons you are to learn among other things at your entring under the tuition of another Miſtreſs, as I have ſaid, you muſt for ſome Months. And yet if the Ladies Hair be ſhort (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it ought) and her conſtitution will bear it, ſhe may well in my opinion, at warm ſeaſons of the year, omit co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering her Hair with any attire; which
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60403:71"/>
of themſelves afford the Eyes, and Touch a pleaſing diverſion: and yet in that negligence there is a <hi>decorum</hi> to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to render ſuch a fantaſtical Undreſs more agreeable. All her Linnen whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about her Bed, her Perſon, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing otherwiſe to her Lodgings, muſt be exquiſitely neat and pure, as well as rich and coſtly. And when this cannot be had, the former muſt not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

               <p>A glittering ſhew dazles the Eye, and wins much, on even the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal part of Man: he is aſhamed to make any mean offers, when all things about him are full of pomp and gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: he will think it reaſonable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to good Manners, to be liberal, when he meets with luxurious fare; and a breach of one of the points of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry civility, not to proportion his genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to the ſtate aed quality of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. When he is hungry, and in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60403:72"/>
haſt, a man of buſineſs will ſometimes ſculk into a naſty Cook's Shop for a Six Penny Cut, which he would bluſh to talk of in any of the firſt rate Houſes of Entertainment. Many Traders can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not maintain this advantagious Poſt of Pomp and Magnificence: thoſe then that are Frigates of a ſmaller ſize, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Rate, muſt be ſtored with ready and eaſy excuſes, to palliate the diſorder of their weak Tackling. The pretence of having been lately ſnatched from under her Parents Wings, or deſerted the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of a cruel Husband, may ſerve ſometimes to gain her a reputation, of being ſound freſh Food, and ſufficient likewiſe to excuſe a weak and a ſlender beginning. When this ſham will not fix (do not interrupt me by finding fault with the word) let her feign ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky diſaſter, almoſt unavoidable, and which may be apt to move compaſſion: as that ſome barbarous <hi>Debauchée</hi> had lately ſeduced her out of her Virginity and Fortune, with the promiſe of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, or Maintaining her as his Miſtreſs, with a plentiful Annuity for life. Let her always exerciſe this cheat, as that it may appear, ſhe is but a young beginner;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60403:72"/>

            <p>THus the good old Lady terminated her firſt days Diſcourſe, to the no ſmall ſatisfaction of her fair Pupil: who was much overjoyed at the hopes ſhe entertained of ſuch a bleſſed altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in her affairs, as, ſhe doubted not would be the effect of her School-mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes providential care. They got up from their Seats by mutual conſent: Mother <hi>Creſwel,</hi> to yawn and ſtretch her aged Limbs; being tired with long ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and no leſs wearied with bearing ſuch a large ſhare in that days Dialogue.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60403:79"/>
The like did young <hi>Dorothea,</hi> as having either the like neceſſities, or that ſhe thought it civil to ſympathize thus far with her kind Miſtreſs. After they had entertained one another ſome ſmall time in an indifferent converſation, <hi>Dorothea</hi> remembred by her Stomach, that Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner time was already paſt, and therefore thought it expedient to lay the Cloth, whilſt the Maid made ready ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions as the Cavalier's Houſe could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. It was for the moſt part ſo ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the Maſter of the Family did ſeldom dine at his own Table, but was willing to invite himſelf abroad among his old Friends, who had not been ſo unfortunate, as to ſpend their Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, in hopes of any incertain futurity. This gave the Virgin much ſolitary lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and at this time a fit opportunity of hearing the Bawds Lectures, without the danger of any diſturbance. Among other paſſages at Dinner, ſhe asked her Daughter particularly of the ſtate her Fathers affairs were at preſent in; How he ſtood affected as to his Morals, his temper and diſpoſition, and many ſuch minute circumſtances; that from the knowledge of thoſe ſhe might infer her
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60403:80"/>
own concluſions, and the moſt plauſible means, her Scholar might make uſe of to relinquiſh her Parents Houſe, and put her ſelf under the tuition of a new choſe Mother. <hi>Dorothea</hi> told her to that, She was ſure his humour was ſuch, as that he would never conſent to part with her on any indirect terms: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now on the borders of old age, and weary of the Town, he had reſolved very ſoon to retire, and end his days in the ſolitude of a Country life. This was pleaſing news to the decripit Hag, who elſe might have been diſappointed in her hopes of propagating her Faith, by adding this Maid to the number of her Converts. It was then reſolved, <hi>Dorothea</hi> ſhould remain in Town after her Fathers departure, under the pretence of getting into ſome creditable Service: to which they concluded, the Gentleman would readily agree, as not being himſelf ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated to make any better Proviſion for his Daughter. When Dinner was ended, and all fit meaſures taken in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the adjuſting that affair, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving any ſtops that might fall in the way: The Lady Abbeſs took leave of her young Probationer, to diſpatch

ſome affairs of her own elſewhere; having promiſed to return next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the ſame Hour ſhe had done that day.</p>

               <p>This Morning a little before day, methought I was in a large, high and ſpatious Room, which as I fanſied was furniſhed with the richeſt and moſt lively Tapeſtry that I had before ever ſeen. Over this coſtly Arras there hung all about the Room, rich gilt Swords, of all faſhions, <hi>French, German, Polonian</hi> Scymeters, and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Toledoes, fine Beavers, a great number of Point Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vats of all ſorts, <hi>Venetian,</hi> thoſe which come from <hi>Paris,</hi> and the other we have from <hi>Lorain;</hi> ſome furred Gowns, ſuch as Aldermen wear; two or three Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants Coifs, a number of Lawyers. Gowns, ſome Velvet Coats and Ebony Canes, a multitude of imbroidered ones, ſome Scarlet, others of Crimſon-Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, with many more braveries that have ſlipt my memory. At one ſide of the Room there ſtood a ſumptuous Bed, the Curtains whereof were all Cloth of Gold; near the Bed there was a magnificent Chair of State, ſuch as I once ſaw at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> whereon the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60403:81"/>
King ſits when a Foreign Embaſſador is admitted to his firſt Audience. In this Throne, I thought, I ſaw my ſelf ſeated, with a regal Scepter in my Hand, and a Crown of Gold on my Head: round about me there ſtood almoſt as great a variety of Beaſts as were ſaid to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, as Aſſes, Sheep, Buffles, Foxes, Peacocks, Woodcocks, ſeveral ſorts of Owls, Dotterels and Gulls; in tormenting all theſe I fanſied my ſelf mightily pleaſed; I took ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar delight in beating ſome and pricking others, in pulling the Peacocks Trains, and the Feathers from the other Birds: all which methought they ſuffer'd with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous patience; without any ſign of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; nay the Beaſts lickt me from top to Toe, ſhewing marks of content in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus cruelly treated. After I was weary of this exerciſe, I thought all the Brutes diſappeared, and that there only remained with me a little Fox, that was grown grey with age, that had by ſome accident loſt his Tail almoſt to the Rump, to which was faſtened a Bag of Money ſo large that the Animal was ſcarce able to draw it after him; but yet with much ado, I perceived him ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60403:82"/>
into the ſtately Bed; where I had not imagined him ſetled any time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there returned a ſtately young Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffle fat and comely (by the by, Mother, I never ſaw this Creature, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciption ſuppoſe it is like one of our Bulls) who forcibly took me on his Horns, from whence I could by no means free my ſelf, till the Bull gave me leave to alight in the midſt of a mighty Foreſt, and there methought I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to draw in a Yoak with this wild Beaſt: the fright of which awakened me in great confuſion. And now I deſire to hear you declare the meaning of this extravagant Viſion.</p>

               <p>A Whore indeed ought to have skill in Phyſiognomies. Reading Men is the great work of her life.

which in our Idiom ſignifies no more than not to love any Man for the titles of Genteel, Handſome or Witty, unleſs theſe qualifications be attended with the ſolidity of a weighty Purſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>It is reaſonable, but I preſume a little difficult exactly to follow that rule.</p>

               <p>I do aſſure you, if my Mothers Clay were animated a ſecond time, ſhe could not oblige you with a Precept of more uſe or comprehenſion, and ſhe was one of the wiſeſt of the Daughters of Men, nay, or Sons, ſaving <hi>Solomon</hi> his right. Therefore <hi>Dorothea</hi> you muſt take more than ordinary care in this point, on the critical obſervation of which does much depend a Whores Fortune and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement. On this ſcore, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your reading Romances, where conſtancy in love is cryed up as a vertue, and dying Lovers make up a great part in the Pageantry. The Modern Comedies are a Lecture much more adapted to the intereſt of my Scholar, for there you will find fraud and diſſimulation called diſcretion and prudence: cuckold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Husbands, cheating Lovers, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſtyled Addreſs and Wit. And for obſcenity I recommend thoſe pieces to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60403:91"/>
you, where you may be ſupplyed with a better ſtock than I can in Conſcience expoſe in this my Rhetorick.</p>

               <p>You have proceeded hitherto in modeſt terms, however I underſtood your meaning. But ſeeing it concerns me ſo highly not to be in love with any perſon; I deſire you will preſcribe me ſome Antidotes in caſe I ſhould unawares ſuck in any of that fatal poyſon: for I muſt confeſs to you, Mother, I can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truſt my ſelf in this caſe; I fear a good Dreſs, and a good Face, might yet have on me dangerous effects.</p>

               <p>Alas! that is one of the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and one of the curſes which the firſt Womans ſin entailed on the whole Sex. I could make thee a longer Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Love, than <hi>Baxter</hi> did on a <hi>Thurſday</hi> Morning; I could come to the Nineteenthly, if I did not believe thy own diſcretion informs thee, the leaſt ſpark of this dangerous fire would infallibly ruin all thy hopes of good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and thy proſpect of any future fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity: let my coſtly experience teach thee Wiſdom: a ſmall ſincere flame was my bane, and in the whole courſe of my years, I never knew any one Whore
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60403:92"/>
eſcape a miſerable and a beggarly end, who was ſo weak as to entertain any ſpark of a true love. Do but conſider the impertinent cauſes of this ſilly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: that the moſt inſignificant circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances about Men, as their Garb, and ſuch like are the ſtrong Philters that cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the weaker Sex. It is certainly true, that Women are caught for the moſt part in ſuch weak Nets as theſe, that the moſt ſhallow, the moſt inſipid, nay, the uglyeſt of Men have been the moſt ſucceſsful in gaining an aſcendant over the hearts of poor Women. You muſt know, <hi>Dorothea,</hi> that no Man is valuable on any endowment that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from the Soul; what ever ows its original to the Body, is brutal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Beaſts enjoy it in an equal meaſure with Men: nay, in every particular they are out-done by ſome meer Animal, The Ox is ſtronger, the Horſe is ſwifter and the Goat more ſalacious, till humane nature is debauched by art. I never knew a Lady enamoured of any Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, for being an expert or a brave Souldier, loyal, learned, or wiſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as theſe are the only qualifications that create a real diſtinction between Men,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60403:92"/>
and make one Man more worthy than another. Seeing then the noble, the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of Men is not able to kindle a flame in a Womans Breaſt, let her ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be enſlaved by any thing that is of a far more vile, baſe and degenerate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: if ſhe be ſecure of receiving no wounds from the valiant, and the wiſe, ſhe will ſure be able to guard her ſelf from the darts of daſtardly Fools. It muſt needs be a ſufficient preſervative againſt loves infection, to conſider that the ſpruce incentives, the Sparks who are moſt dangerous, have never any thing in them, but what their Dancing or Singing Maſters were pleaſed to retail unto them.</p>

               <p>I know not where you got that fabulous Story, it muſt be out of ſome Romance; for my Author who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted an authentick and faithful Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, tells me, That <hi>Thaleſtris</hi> (for that as I remember was the Queens name) came to <hi>Alexander</hi> as a Soveraign Princeſs, not as a whining Lover, with a ſplendid band of her own Subjects, not like an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuppliant, commanding rather than intreating that great King, to ſtop in the carreer of his Victories, till he left ſomething in her Womb; which if of the genuine Sex, might prove an Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs to the Kingdom, and ſucceed in her Mothers Throne.

There will then be no fear of poyſonous Arrows, or inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed Darts, when ſhe once gets the man-hating quality, becauſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers deliver it as an Article of their Creed, that two contraries cannot by any means cohabit under one roof, no more than two Whores, at leaſt not without mighty feuds and reſtleſs ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities.</p>

               <p>Let my Pupil reſt fully aſſured that the moſt profitable, eaſy and ſecure Traffick is to deal with honeſt wealthy Citizens. A rich Mercer can with more eaſe rig out a Whore, than a ſcore of ranting blades: and an Apprentice that is Caſh-keeper to a ſubſtantial Citizen can oblige a young Lady, with larger ſupplies than a Regiment of modiſh Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen. Theſe are the golden Lovers, you muſt by all poſſible arts endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make your own: a ſmall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Flattery, and a ſpice of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Affection will be ſufficient baits to captivate theſe mute Fiſh; when once they are faſt in the Net, there is but little danger of their making eſcape; a frown, a contracted Brow, or a harſh word will quiet them at any time, and make them willing to gratifie your moſt exorbitant demands.</p>

to want, or care for their money, you will the eaſier arrive at the end of your own deſires: and by ſtanding on your punctilios, be able on all occaſions, to calm the heat and extravagance of any inſulting Hector, not ſuffering your ſelf to be fed with that aery nutriment (loud big words) which is the uſual entertainment of certain <hi>Bravos.</hi> With all Men without diſtinction of perſons, you muſt ſtudy to be in your diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and cheating Talents crafty and cunning, in your delights graceful, and in your perſwaſions powerful: thus you will in ſome ſort imitate the good Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and fulfil the practical Doctrines in your own Rhetorick. The memory which belongs properly to you, is not ſo much an immenſe capacity, qualified to receive and retain all objects repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the exterior, and thence introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the general and interior ſenſe; as an artificial ready remembrance of all points neceſſary in your own Trade, and the perſwading power of your elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which conſiſts in timing your words and actions with a ſeaſonable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, aſſigning every part of your art its proper place, and feeding your

               <p>When you are detained in ugly, ſordid, or ungrateful embraces; it would be difficult without the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial aid of a picture to counterfeit thoſe ecſtaſies which every comer may expect for his money. Therefore on theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions you muſt frame in your mind the Idea of ſome comely Youth who pleaſes you beſt, whoſe ſhadow will create a greater guſt than could be raiſed by a nauſeous though real enjoyment. The Picture of this charming Boy may very fitly be placed near your Bed, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print the fancy deeper in your imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and enable you to fall into thoſe

               <p>That was the caution I did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to deduce from the Doctrine of Images. You muſt with all ſtrangers and new friends, or ſuch on whom you have particular deſigns, make it your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to appear wholly ignorant in all new modes, or at leaſt you muſt handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretend that nature, and ſometimes a mighty affection, and deſire to pleaſe your Lover, has inſpired you with this dexterity.</p>

               <p>I cannot be againſt what you ſay, for it may prove inconvenient, that your knowledge ſhould be thought to proceed from art and experience; for Men do for the moſt part believe this ſort of skill in Women, as nauſeous in an amorous converſation, as a Pedant's learning in civil ſociety; unleſs it be
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60403:103"/>
when they may conclude themſelves the Authors and Inſtructers in this piece of obſcene gallantry.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60403:114"/>
of Harmony, and where there is the leaſt appendix wanting, a harſh diſcord is thereby created as certainly in Love, as it is in Muſick. A ſymmetry in the Perſon, Dreſs and Speech of a Lady that would excite Love, is as requiſite as an accurate Player, a good Inſtrument, and right in tune, to raiſe a harmonious proportion in muſical numbers.</p>

               <p>A good tale cannot be told too oft; therefore I tell you, your Voice muſt be ſtill in tune, to hinder your Gallant from being ſurprized with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, that might, if ſuffered to grow on him, deſtroy loves Empire, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the vertue of your eloquence, and ruine all the political deſigns of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. There is no abſolute neceſſity you ſhould exceed in the knowledge of this art; it is ſufficient to be able on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to entertain your friend with a lively Song, and to give life to certain artificial graces, which in a young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Mouth breath a moſt ſweet air, to refreſh and fan that flame, which ſometimes finds reception in the centre of an enamoured Heart. No grave heavy canticles muſt be heard at theſe times, but all amorous compoſitions apt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite luxury, and create a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. It is fit to obſerve a ſeaſonable diſcretion, in diſpoſing the Muſick in its proper place, not to prove tedious with the length, nor troubleſome by ſinging at ſuch ſeaſons, when the appetite may poſſibly require an entertainment of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature.</p>

               <p>Beſide this, there is another kind of harmony, a young Lady ought to acquire by practice on her own Voice: I mean an agreeable tone and ſweet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in the expreſſion of each word in ordinary converſation.</p>

               <p>Not by any certain rules of art, but muſt be attained by your own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and practice. I have known Women do miracles with a ſweet dying Voice; and indeed nothing can be more prevalent on the affection of any Man, than to hear a handſome Female expreſs her ſelf in apt terms, articulated with the advantage of a languiſhing air. In this particular you muſt play the Orator, to adorn every period with all the embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments, Voice, Eyes and corporal Geſtures can afford, ſtill diſcreetly vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſome points, as the different cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Perſon, matter, time and place may require. If you cannot at firſt arrive at a height of perfection in this affair, be not diſcouraged by a ſlender proficiency in your firſt attempts, you muſt frequently experiment your skill

alone, as if your play fellow were liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to every word: however if you advance not to a high pitch in this vertue, you muſt be at ſome extraordinary pains to manage your tongue, if you cannot perfectly regulate your Voice.</p>

               <p>Quality and reputation are fine things, Child, but are not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move a certain itch natural to our Sex: Honour in Women advances them only to act the Whore in a higher ſphere, does not all contribute to quench the flame; for as there are two ſorts of Beggers, one that with a ſtretched out Arm, implores the charitable aſſiſtance of all that he meets; the other a Begger of Quality, that craves as heartily, but with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grace, of ſome worthy Patron in an honourable Dedication: ſo beſides the Whore who receives the benevolence of all Men, and whoſe office I have already deſcribed, there is another equally cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60403:123"/>
of <hi>Cupid</hi>'s charity, though ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates her ſelf to a particular Gallant, who has treaſure enough in his Veins to ſupply her honourable requeſts.</p>

               <p>I have already told you the great advantage you may hope to reap by a dexterous movement of the Body.

               <p>Not to relinquiſh the form of a Rhetorick, and the ſubject of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, I remember to have heard that <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> if I miſtake not, had the reputation of a ready and an expert Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. To become perfect in the mimical part, he made uſe of a Glaſs, large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to repreſent his whole perſon in its full dimenſion. Before this he uſed
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60403:124"/>
to make proof of himſelf, and in it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his own failings, he thus found it eaſy to correct them, and imprint in his memory that action or geſture which ſeemed to himſelf moſt agreeable and moſt likely to pleaſe others.</p>

               <p>They are ſometimes bought up as Kings marry their Wives, even before their Faces are ſeen. But they

            <sp>

               <p>That is probable: becauſe Masks ſeem unneceſſary to make them known; for Ladies of buſineſs, they ſay, may be diſcovered by their look, mien, and many other ſigns and tokens.</p>

               <p>A young Trader ought to be extreamly induſtrious to preſerve her Face as long as ſhe can, under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſtrange and new: ſo it ever proves of ill conſequence to be frequently ſeen bare-faced at Plays or any other publick places, which is well avoided by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing under the ſafe cover of a vizard.</p>

               <p>I'de allow her ſometimes to be ſeen without a falſe Face, but generally it is moſt convenient to make her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets under a diſguiſe, ſhe thereby is at liberty of going off with whom ſhe likes beſt, without diſobliging others; and as I told you now, ſhe avoids the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of being Fly-blown, or bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by the contagious Eyes of any ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Cabal.</p>
